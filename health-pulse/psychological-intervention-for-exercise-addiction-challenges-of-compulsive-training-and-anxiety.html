    <div id="article-description"><p>Psychological Intervention for Exercise Addiction: Challenges of Compulsive Training and Anxiety üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí• In recent years, exercise addiction has become an increasingly concerning mental - health issue. With the popularization of fitness culture, more and more people are engaging in high - intensity exercise. However, some individuals, while pursuing fitness results, fall into an inescapable compulsion for exercise. According to the new research entry in the DSM - 5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), exercise addiction is clearly defined as a psychological disorder, characterized by compulsive training, anxiety after stopping exercise, and social - function impairment.</p><h3>üß† Psychological Characteristics of Exercise Addiction: A Blend of Compulsion and Anxiety</h3><h4>1Ô∏è‚É£ Compulsive Training</h4><p>One of the core features of exercise addiction is compulsive training. For addicts, exercise is no longer for health or entertainment but has become an uncontrollable impulse. Whether the body is tired or sick, they still force themselves to exercise. This behavior is often accompanied by excessive control over the amount of exercise, sometimes even exceeding the body's tolerance.</p><h4>2Ô∏è‚É£ Anxiety after Stopping Exercise</h4><p>After stopping or taking a few days' rest from exercise, exercise addicts often feel extremely anxious and restless. They may experience low mood, irritability, and even some physical discomfort. Many are afraid that rest will lead to a decline in physical condition and negative emotions, so they can't stop and continue to over - exercise.</p><h4>3Ô∏è‚É£ Impaired Social Function</h4><p>People who are long - term addicted to exercise often neglect their social life and relationships with family and friends. Excessive exercise may cause them to be unable to integrate into social situations and even lose the ability to connect with others. Their social circle becomes narrower, and the quality of life declines.</p><h3>‚öñÔ∏è Diagnostic Criteria for Exercise Addiction: A Comprehensive Consideration of Cognition and Behavior</h3><p>According to the new entry in the DSM - 5, the diagnostic criteria for exercise addiction mainly include the following aspects:</p><ul><li>Exercise compulsion: Continuous, high - intensity exercise behavior that often exceeds the normal range of healthy exercise.</li><li>Inability to control the amount of exercise: Even when aware of the potential negative impacts of over - exercise, they still can't reduce the amount of exercise.</li><li>Anxiety or emotional instability after stopping exercise: Significant anxiety and emotional fluctuations occur when taking a rest or reducing the amount of exercise.</li><li>Social impact: Excessive exercise affects personal social life and career development, reduces interaction with others, and even impacts intimate relationships.</li></ul><h3>üí° Psychological Intervention Methods for Exercise Addiction: How to Break the Vicious Cycle of Exercise Compulsion?</h3><h4>1Ô∏è‚É£ Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</h4><p>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is one of the most effective treatment methods at present. By changing the cognitive biases of exercise addicts towards exercise, it helps them recognize the negative impacts of over - exercise and then adjust their exercise behavior. CBT helps patients understand the emotional drivers behind compulsive training and how to replace inappropriate exercise behavior with healthier ways.</p><h4>2Ô∏è‚É£ Anxiety Management Skills</h4><p>Since exercise addicts often experience anxiety symptoms when they stop exercising, it is crucial to help them master effective anxiety - management skills. Methods such as meditation, deep breathing, and relaxation training can effectively relieve anxiety after stopping exercise, help exercise addicts stabilize their emotions, and gradually reduce their compulsive dependence on exercise.</p><h4>3Ô∏è‚É£ Establishing Healthy Exercise Goals</h4><p>Set reasonable and achievable exercise goals for exercise addicts to avoid excessive compulsive training. Help them recognize the benefits of moderate exercise for physical and mental health, rather than regarding exercise as a mere physical challenge. By setting short - term and long - term goals, gradually reduce the amount of exercise and avoid unhealthy habits caused by intense exercise.</p><h4>4Ô∏è‚É£ Building a Social Support System</h4><p>Encourage exercise addicts to build a healthy social support system during the treatment process, maintain good interaction with family and friends, and participate in social activities to avoid over - focusing on exercise. Family therapy and group support can also provide effective help, enhance emotional connection, and reduce the sense of isolation caused by exercise addiction.</p><h3>üí¨ Expert Opinion: Exercise Should Serve Physical and Mental Health</h3><p>Experts point out that exercise should be a tool to improve physical and mental health, not a burden. If exercise becomes a compulsive behavior and even affects an individual's normal life, emotions, and social relationships, timely intervention is needed. The correct concept of exercise should be to enjoy the pleasure it brings, rather than regarding it as a source of stress.</p><h3>üîë Key Reminders</h3><ul><li>üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The original intention of exercise is to improve physical health, not to become a burden.</li><li>‚öñÔ∏è Moderate exercise can help relieve stress and enhance physical fitness, while long - term compulsive exercise may have negative impacts.</li><li>üí¨ If you or your relatives and friends have exercise - addiction problems, seeking professional help as early as possible is the key to recovery.</li></ul><h3>üåü Conclusion: Aim for Health and Embrace the True Meaning of Exercise</h3><p>Exercise should be a lifestyle, not just a means of escape or compulsion. Through appropriate intervention methods, we can help those with exercise addiction get out of trouble and rediscover a healthy balance in exercise. Exercise should make us happier and healthier, not a heavy burden in life.</p><p>üå± Let exercise be a good medicine for the body and mind, not a mental shackle!</p></div>
