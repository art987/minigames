    <div id="article-description"><p>Today, let's talk about a psychological topic that's getting hotter and more controversial among young people: the controversy over anxiety disorder and overdiagnosis.</p><h3>📱 #MentalHealth: When "Anxiety" Goes Viral on TikTok</h3><p>In recent years, "anxiety disorder" is no longer an obscure medical term. Especially on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, the number of video contents under the hashtags #Anxiety and #MentalHealth has skyrocketed.</p><p>💡 Interesting data:</p><ul><li>The view count of the #Anxiety tag on TikTok has exceeded 20 billion.</li><li>A large number of content creators share their "anxiety experiences", psychological assessments, and the process of using medications.</li><li>Some short - videos encourage viewers to self - diagnose based on "symptom lists" and infer whether they need medication or treatment on their own.</li></ul><h3>😬 Phenomenon: Is Anxiety Being "Misused"?</h3><p>After watching these videos, many young people left messages in the comment section: "I always thought it was just my personality problem. It turns out I have an anxiety disorder!"</p><p>It may seem like an awakening of psychological awareness, but it has also raised questions in the medical community - "Are these videos turning normal emotional fluctuations into 'diseases'?"</p><p>Medical professionals are worried that social platforms are giving rise to a culture of "psychological disorder name identification". People use labels like "anxiety", "social phobia", and "ADHD" to define themselves, ignoring the seriousness of diagnosis and medical standards.</p><h3>💊 Is Anxiety Being "Over - Medicalized"?</h3><p>This is one of the biggest controversies at present, especially focusing on the relationship between "pharmaceutical companies" and the "expansion of the definition of mental illness".</p><p>📚 A review of the background:</p><ul><li>Over the past few decades, the definition of anxiety - related disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) has gradually expanded.</li><li>Previously, only severe patients with "anxiety disorders" were defined as such. Now, phenomena like daily nervousness, test anxiety, and social avoidance may also be classified as "symptoms".</li><li>Meanwhile, the anti - anxiety drug market has expanded rapidly, with a global market value of over billions of dollars.</li></ul><p>🎯 Some people hold the view that:</p><p>"Not every emotional distress requires drug treatment. Pharmaceutical companies are expanding their consumer market through 'overdiagnosis'."</p><h3>⚖️ Disagreements in the Medical Community</h3><p>🩺 One school of thought believes that:</p><ul><li>Diseases like depression and anxiety are easily overlooked in the early stages. "Expanding the definition" helps the public pay more attention.</li><li>More and more young people are willing to face up to psychological problems, which is a positive development.</li></ul><p>🧠 The other school of thought refutes:</p><ul><li>Quickly "labeling" normal emotional ups and downs actually reduces the attention on real patients.</li><li>Abusing drugs may lead to drug dependence, side effects, and even the worsening of symptoms.</li><li>"Disease - naming" may actually increase anxiety - "I'm just a bit stressed. Do I really have a disease?"</li></ul><h3>🧭 How to View "Anxiety" Rationally?</h3><ol><li>Don't self - diagnose based solely on online content. Videos, assessment forms, and jokes are not equivalent to medical diagnoses. Consult a professional psychologist when you feel unwell.</li><li>Emotions are not equal to diseases. Everyone experiences anxiety, nervousness, and insomnia at times. Not every emotion represents an illness.</li><li>Medical intervention does not equal drug treatment. Treating anxiety does not necessarily mean taking medicine. Psychological counseling, cognitive - behavioral therapy (CBT), meditation, and exercise are all first - line recommended therapies.</li><li>Beware of the self - limitation brought by the "label culture". Recognize your own problems instead of being confined by the "disease name".</li></ol><h3>💬 Summary & A Gentle Reminder:</h3><p>Anxiety is not a trendy label, nor is every moment of unease a "disease" that needs to be suppressed by drugs. We should face up to mental health, but also reject hasty diagnoses and over - medication. May you be brave, clear - headed, and gentle with yourself when facing stress.</p></div>
