    <div id="article-description"><h3>🎯 Introduction</h3><p>Hello! 👋 I'm your health detective. 🔍 Today, let's talk about a quiet but far - reaching pharmaceutical revolution: the battle of oral GLP - 1 receptor agonists! If you've ever thought: 'I wish I could lose weight without getting injections...' or 'Weight - loss injections are too expensive and hard to get. Is there an oral version?' Then you really need to get to know Novo Nordisk's oral Semaglutide!</p><h3>💊 Self - Introduction</h3><p>I'm an ordinary person who is terrified of injections but loves cakes. 🍰💉 When I heard about a 'weight - loss injection you can swallow', I immediately started researching. 📚</p><h3>🚀 Background: The Weight - Loss Myth of GLP - 1 Drugs</h3><p>In the past few years, 'GLP - 1 receptor agonists' have become the hottest anti - obesity drug category globally:</p><table><tr><th>Drug Name</th><th>Form</th><th>Brand</th><th>Weight - Loss Effect</th></tr><tr><td>Ozempic</td><td>Injection</td><td>Novo Nordisk</td><td>~15%</td></tr><tr><td>Wegovy</td><td>Injection</td><td>Novo Nordisk</td><td>~15%</td></tr><tr><td>Mounjaro (Tirzepatide)</td><td>Injection</td><td>Eli Lilly</td><td>~21%</td></tr><tr><td>Oral Semaglutide</td><td>💊 Oral</td><td>Novo Nordisk</td><td>📈 Comparable to injections!</td></tr></table><h3>💥 Case Highlight: Novo Nordisk's Oral Semaglutide Debuts Strongly!</h3><p>📌 Drug name: Rybelsus. 💊 Specifications: 3mg / 7mg / 14mg. 📊 In the 2023 OASIS 1 trial, a 50mg oral dose of Semaglutide achieved an average weight loss of 15.1%, almost matching the injection version of Wegovy! This is not just a simple 'conversion to a capsule'. Novo Nordisk added an absorption enhancer (SNAC) to enable Semaglutide, a large - molecule drug that is difficult to absorb, to be effectively absorbed in the stomach. This breakthrough is hailed as:</p><p>🎉 'A milestone in large - molecule oral drugs'</p><h3>🔥 The Market Is Booming, and the Oral Version Becomes the New Main Battlefield in the GLP - 1 War!</h3><p>Why do people want to develop oral versions?</p><ol><li>💉 Say goodbye to the fear of injections.</li><li>💊 Higher convenience in taking the medicine.</li><li>✅ Improved compliance and greater user stickiness.</li><li>💰 Expected to reduce pharmaceutical and distribution costs (injection drugs require cold storage and professional operation).</li></ol><h3>🥊 Who Are the Players in the Oral GLP - 1 Track?</h3><table><tr><th>Pharmaceutical Company</th><th>Product Name</th><th>Status</th></tr><tr><td>Novo Nordisk</td><td>Rybelsus (Semaglutide)</td><td>Launched (for diabetes) / 50mg weight - loss version in clinical trials</td></tr><tr><td>Pfizer</td><td>Danuglipron</td><td>Phase II clinical trials, not yet widely used</td></tr><tr><td>Eli Lilly</td><td>Orforglipron</td><td>Phase III in progress, regarded as the'strongest competitor'</td></tr><tr><td>vTv Therapeutics</td><td>TTP399</td><td>In the early stage of research and development</td></tr></table><h3>⚠️ Challenges and Controversies: Oral Drugs Aren't All Advantages</h3><p>Although the oral version 'seems great', there are also many technical and usage thresholds:</p><ul><li>🚧 Strict medication rules. ● Rybelsus requires taking it on an empty stomach, in the morning, with water, and not eating or drinking for 30 minutes after taking it. ● The onset of the drug effect is slower than that of injections. ● Although SNAC improves absorption, it also causes gastric irritation and increases side effects.</li><li>💊 The cost has not significantly decreased. Due to the complex production process and high dosage, the actual price is not very different from that of injections (in the short term).</li></ul><h3>🧠 Future Scientific Trends: More Potent and Intelligent Oral Drugs</h3><p>🌱 The scientific community is currently exploring:</p><ul><li>📦 Nanoparticle delivery systems (to enhance stability).</li><li>🧬 RNA/protein modification to extend the half - life.</li><li>🤖 AI - assisted discovery of more efficient receptor agonists.</li></ul><h3>📌 Summary</h3><p>The oral version is not a replacement but an expansion of choices. ✅ It is more friendly to those who are afraid of injections and for early intervention. ✅ It is more beneficial for chronic disease management and global market promotion. ✅ For end - users, it provides one more choice and less anxiety. Although oral GLP - 1 drugs cannot completely replace injections at present, they are quietly changing the entire landscape of weight - loss treatment. 🌍 In the future, perhaps all you need to start losing weight is a small pill. 💊</p></div>
