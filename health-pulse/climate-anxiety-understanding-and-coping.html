    <div id="article-description"><p>Today, we're going to talk about a real - life feeling that makes people more nervous than the weather forecast - **Climate Anxiety** 🌍🌪️</p><h3>🌡️ "Will our generation have a future?"</h3><p>Generation Z (born between 1995 and 2010) is being surrounded by a brand - new sense of anxiety. It's not about school admissions or the rat - race, but rather, "How much longer can the Earth survive?"</p><p>📊 According to a Lancet survey covering 10 countries, 75% of teenagers said they "fear for the future", and 56% believed that "humanity is doomed". What they see on their feeds are not motivational quotes, but:</p><ul><li>Accelerated melting of Arctic glaciers</li><li>Reversal of carbon emissions in the Amazon rainforest</li><li>Sea - level rise threatening coastal cities</li><li>"The global temperature is approaching the critical point."</li></ul><p>This is not just 'environmental anxiety', but a deep - seated existential dread - Will I have children? Does my hard work make any sense?</p><h3>🔥 Manifestations of Climate Anxiety</h3><h4>📍 Psychological level:</h4><ul><li>Excessive attention to climate news, even 'doomscrolling'</li><li>Feelings of powerlessness, anger, and despair: 'Why aren't they doing something?'</li><li>Repeatedly imagining doomsday scenarios of the Earth and suffering from long - term insomnia</li></ul><h4>📍 Behavioral level:</h4><ul><li>Abandoning certain life plans (such as having children)</li><li>Compulsive environmental - protection behaviors (extreme vegetarianism, refusing to use transportation)</li><li>Radical 'climate despairism': believing that it's hopeless to save the planet</li></ul><p>📊 Data shows:</p><ul><li>A global survey published in The Lancet found that 75% of young people think 'the future is terrifying'.</li><li>More than **45%** of respondents said 'climate change has affected my daily life functions'.</li><li>They described climate change as 'betrayal', 'a neglected danger', 'a cage with no escape'.</li></ul><p>This anxiety is not just an environmental issue, but an existential crisis.</p><h3>😰 What impacts can climate anxiety bring?</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Manifestation</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Emotional burden</td><td>Intensification of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and feelings of helplessness</td></tr><tr><td>Behavioral withdrawal</td><td>Avoiding future planning, losing motivation, and feeling indifferent to the world</td></tr><tr><td>Physical symptoms</td><td>Accelerated heart rate, inattention, and gastrointestinal disorders</td></tr></tbody></table><p>"If the Earth can't even last a hundred years, why should I study, work, or fall in love?" - This is not a dramatization, but a real confession in the hearts of many young people.</p><h3>🧠 The emergence of climate psychology: 'Treat emotions with low - carbon methods'</h3><p>Some European and American countries are starting to recognize that this anxiety is not just an emotional fluctuation, but a psychological reaction to global risks.</p><p>🛠️ One of the coping measures:</p><p>🧯 The 'Climate Mental Health First Aid' course is being incorporated into middle - school and university education. The course content includes:</p><ul><li>How to regulate emotions related to climate anxiety (meditation, cognitive - therapy techniques)</li><li>How to find a sense of action in the face of anxiety (community environmental protection, policy advocacy)</li><li>How to communicate your 'environmental anxiety' to relatives and friends without being laughed at</li><li>How to distinguish 'pseudo - environmental anxiety' (anxiety incited by marketing)</li></ul><p>This is not just psychological building, but also the cultivation of 'inter - generational resilience'.</p><h3>🌱 Heal anxiety with action</h3><p>Psychologists generally believe that the core problem of climate anxiety is not 'fear', but 'powerlessness'.</p><p>✅ Effective ways to relieve climate anxiety:</p><ul><li>Join local environmental - protection organizations or campus greening groups</li><li>Participate in the 'Climate Letter - writing' campaign (write to policymakers)</li><li>Launch a 'weekly carbon - reduction challenge' with friends</li><li>Pay attention to positive climate news, such as breakthroughs in renewable energy and progress in international environmental - protection agreements</li></ul><p>This kind of behavior is called **'Empowering Eco - Action'**. It's not just empty talk, but a real way to enhance the sense of control.</p><h3>✅ How to self - heal in the face of anxiety?</h3><p>🌤️ Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Acknowledge your anxiety and don't think of it as 'being overly sensitive' or 'unnecessary'.</li><li>Limit your exposure to news or social media regularly to avoid being overwhelmed by information.</li><li>Share your feelings with peers instead of suffering alone. Find someone you trust to talk to.</li><li>Participate in environmental - protection activities without being too hard on yourself. Environmental protection doesn't mean self - deprivation.</li><li>Remember: You're not an isolated individual, but a part of the change in the ecosystem.</li></ul><h3>🫂 A gentle reminder</h3><p>Your anxiety is real. It's not 'being overly sensitive'. We can't save the world alone, but together, we can change the world, even if it's just a little bit.</p></div>
