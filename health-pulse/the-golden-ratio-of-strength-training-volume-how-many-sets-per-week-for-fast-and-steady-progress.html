    <div id="article-description"><p>There are many people sweating in the gym, but not many really achieve good results. Why? 🤔 **Training volume** is the key! It's not about training more, but training &ldquo;just right&rdquo; that is the most scientific approach ✨.</p><h3>🔢 What is &ldquo;Training Volume&rdquo;?</h3><p>Training volume = sets × reps × weight. But today we're going to focus on the most core part - &ldquo;how many sets to do per muscle group per week&rdquo;.</p><h3>🧮 Here Comes the Golden Formula!</h3><p>📌 Training sets = body weight (kg) × 0.3</p><table><tr><th>Body weight (kg)</th><th>Recommended weekly training sets (per muscle group)</th></tr><tr><td>50kg</td><td>15 sets</td></tr><tr><td>60kg</td><td>18 sets</td></tr><tr><td>70kg</td><td>21 sets</td></tr><tr><td>80kg</td><td>24 sets</td></tr></table><p>This formula is based on the research and data analysis of hundreds of trainees. It's simple and efficient, suitable for most people.</p><h3>🧠 Why is &ldquo;0.3&rdquo; the Magic Number?</h3><ul><li>✅ Enough stimulation: It provides sufficient tension to stimulate muscle growth (Hypertrophy).</li><li>✅ Good for recovery: It avoids over - training and reduces the risk of fatigue and injury.</li><li>✅ Easy to arrange: You can reasonably distribute the sets whether you train three or four times a week.</li></ul><h3>💪 How to Arrange Weekly Training?</h3><p>Take a person weighing 60kg (about 18 sets per muscle group) as an example. You can distribute the sets like this:</p><h4>🔄 Plan 1: Three - way split training</h4><ul><li>Monday: Chest + Triceps 👉 12 sets for chest + 6 sets for triceps</li><li>Wednesday: Back + Biceps 👉 12 sets for back + 6 sets for biceps</li><li>Friday: Legs + Shoulders 👉 12 sets for legs + 6 sets for shoulders</li></ul><h4>🔄 Plan 2: Full - body training × 3 times</h4><ul><li>Do 6 sets for each of the main full - body muscle groups (chest, back, legs) each time.</li><li>Do 2 - 3 sets for the auxiliary muscles (shoulders, biceps, triceps) as supplementary training.</li></ul><p>📌 Tip: The **core muscle groups (abdomen, lower back)** also need 15 - 20 sets per week, especially for those who sit for long periods!</p><h3>⛔️ What Happens if You Do Too Many or Too Few Sets?</h3><h4>📉 Insufficient training volume</h4><ul><li>Weak muscle response</li><li>Slow progress</li><li>Easy to fall behind</li></ul><h4>🔥 Excessive training volume</h4><ul><li>Poor recovery</li><li>Decline in sleep quality 😴</li><li>Prone to fatigue and frequent injuries 🩹</li></ul><p>✅ Finding the &ldquo;appropriate range&rdquo; is the secret to long - term progress!</p><h3>🧘‍♂️ Recovery is Equally Important!</h3><p>Don't forget, muscles grow during rest, not during training! 💤 Getting good sleep, eating well, and not over - training on rest days are the keys to maintaining high training efficiency.</p><h3>🎯 Summary!</h3><ul><li>✅ Find your body weight × 0.3 = weekly training sets per muscle group</li><li>✅ Reasonably arrange each training session to avoid repetition and cumulative fatigue</li><li>✅ Maintain high - quality movements + sufficient sleep and nutrition to truly &ldquo;get stronger with each workout&rdquo; 🔥</li></ul><p>🎉 The golden ratio is not just a fancy term! Mastering the scientific training volume makes every set effective and every workout progressive! 📈 Now, pick up a pen ✍️ and calculate how many sets you should do this week!</p></div>
