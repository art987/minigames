    <div id="article-description"><p>üö® The Misleading Nature of Influencer Psychological Advice: Toxic Positivity Worsens Conditions</p><p>In today's era of information explosion, the internet has become an important platform for us to acquire knowledge and advice. Many influencer psychological experts share mental - health advice through social media, blogs, and videos. While some advice can have a positive impact, there is also a lot of so - called 'toxic positivity' therapy being spread, which brings wrong psychological concepts to many people and even exacerbates their original psychological problems. Today, let's talk about the misleading nature of these influencer psychological advice and their potential harm to mental health.</p><h3>üß† What is 'toxic positivity' therapy?</h3><p>'Toxic positivity' is a term originating from internet culture, referring to psychological advice that seems positive and inspiring but is actually empty and unrealistic. These suggestions usually emphasize self - strength, ignore the complexity of mental - health problems, and simply attribute them to 'you'll get better as long as you work hard'. For example:</p><ul><li>'If you're unhappy, just adjust your mindset. The world is still wonderful.'</li><li>'If you don't work hard, you'll stay at the bottom forever.'</li><li>'Don't complain. If you can't do it, it just proves you're not strong enough.'</li></ul><p>These statements seem inspiring, but in fact, they ignore the deep - seated causes of psychological problems and individual differences. They simply and rudely require individuals to quickly adjust their emotions, leaving many people in difficult situations feeling more isolated and helpless.</p><h3>üö® The harm of misleading advice:</h3><h4>1. Ignoring individual differences</h4><p>Everyone's psychological condition is unique. Psychological problems cannot be solved by a one - size - fits - all approach of'state - of - mind adjustment' or 'positive energy'. Mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety cannot be overcome simply by self - adjustment. Instead, they may require professional psychological treatment, medication intervention, and long - term psychological support. Simplifying the problem to 'working hard' or'self - adjustment' often traps those who really need help, making them feel that their problems are due to 'not working hard enough' and thus increasing self - blame.</p><h4>2. Aggravating guilt and self - blame</h4><p>Influencer psychological advice often uses extreme language, simply stating that 'if you can't do it, you're not strong enough'. This kind of statement makes people experiencing psychological problems feel more powerless and ashamed, thinking that they don't deserve to seek help or express vulnerability. Staying in this state of self - blame and shame for a long time may lead to more serious psychological problems, such as the aggravation of depression, the worsening of anxiety, and even self - harm behavior.</p><h4>3. Promoting excessive self - reliance</h4><p>Many influencer psychological advice promotes the idea of 'being self - strong', encouraging people to rely too much on themselves to solve problems when facing difficulties and ignoring the importance of seeking professional help. This extreme self - reliance makes individuals feel more isolated when encountering emotional problems they can't solve, unable to effectively seek necessary support, and even stay away from professional treatment, leading to the further deterioration of the problem.</p><h4>4. Misleading the public's understanding of psychological treatment</h4><p>Many influencer psychological advice confuses psychological treatment with simple'self - motivation', misleading people into thinking that psychological problems don't require professional treatment and can be solved only through'state - of - mind adjustment' and 'positive thinking'. This misunderstanding may cause those in need of treatment to miss timely intervention and even delay the illness, resulting in the long - term ineffective alleviation of the disease.</p><h3>‚ö†Ô∏è The gap between online advice and professional treatment:</h3><h4>1. The depth and methods of psychological treatment</h4><p>Professional psychological treatment often relies on a variety of treatment methods, such as cognitive - behavioral therapy, dialectical - behavior therapy, and medication, to provide personalized solutions for different psychological problems. However, online advice is mostly too general and superficial, lacking a detailed analysis of individual psychological symptoms, which easily leads to misguidance.</p><h4>2. Long - term and step - by - step process</h4><p>Solving mental - health problems is not an overnight thing. It usually requires long - term treatment and emotion management. Psychological treatment is a gradual process that requires in - depth communication with professional psychotherapists, rather than a quick fix through short 'inspirational quotes'. Online advice often overemphasizes 'immediate results', and this short - term thinking misleads people's understanding of psychological treatment, making them expect to recover quickly through simple methods.</p><h4>3. Emotional support and companionship</h4><p>In psychological treatment, patients need a supportive environment and emotional companionship, rather than simple'self - adjustment'. Professional psychological treatment can provide in - depth emotional support for individuals, helping them understand their emotions, find the root cause, and gradually recover. In contrast, online advice usually ignores the complexity of emotions, overemphasizes 'positive emotions', and neglects individuals' real feelings and needs.</p><h3>üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How to avoid the influence of misleading advice?</h3><h4>1. Question and verify</h4><p>For mental - health advice on the internet, we should learn to be skeptical and verify it. Especially in terms of self - diagnosis and treatment, we must consult professional psychologists or psychotherapists to avoid blindly following or being misled by online advice.</p><h4>2. Seek professional help</h4><p>If you feel emotionally troubled or your mental problems affect your quality of life, seeking professional help in a timely manner is the wisest choice. Professional psychotherapists can customize effective treatment plans according to individual circumstances, rather than simply giving 'inspirational' advice.</p><h4>3. View online advice rationally</h4><p>The internet is full of various mental - health advice. Some advice is indeed useful, but many are unproven. If you come across advice that doesn't suit your actual situation, you can try to discuss it with professionals and rationally evaluate the value of each piece of information.</p><h3>üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Conclusion:</h3><p>Mental health is a topic that everyone should pay attention to. We should abandon the empty advice of 'toxic positivity', listen to our inner voices, and respect our emotional and psychological needs. When facing difficulties, seeking professional help and maintaining rational thinking are the correct ways to recovery.</p></div>
