    <div id="article-description"><p>As the problem of obesity intensifies, more and more people choose surgical weight loss to solve their weight issues. Among them, sleeve gastrectomy has become a widely used method. This surgery helps patients reduce food intake by removing most of the stomach, thereby achieving weight loss. However, although surgical weight loss can help patients lose weight quickly, the long - term health problems it brings cannot be ignored. In particular, vitamin B12 deficiency after sleeve gastrectomy has become a non - negligible health risk.</p><h3>🥄 The mechanism of sleeve gastrectomy</h3><p>The process of sleeve gastrectomy involves removing most of the stomach, usually leaving only a sleeve - shaped part. This significantly reduces the volume of the stomach and restricts food intake. After the surgery, patients will experience rapid weight loss because the reduced stomach capacity allows them to eat less per meal, thus achieving the weight - loss effect. However, the stomach is an important organ for nutrient absorption, especially for vitamin B12, which relies on certain functions of the stomach to aid absorption. Since the surgery changes the structure of the stomach, resulting in reduced gastric acid secretion, the absorption of vitamin B12 becomes more difficult.</p><h3>⚠️ The risk of vitamin B12 deficiency</h3><p>According to research, the incidence of vitamin B12 deficiency after sleeve gastrectomy exceeds 50%. This means that more than half of the patients may experience vitamin B12 deficiency, and this deficiency can bring a series of serious health problems.</p><h4>1. Nervous system damage 🧠</h4><p>Vitamin B12 is crucial for the nervous system. When deficient, it may cause nerve damage, leading to numbness and tingling in the hands and feet, and may even affect cognitive function. Long - term deficiency may result in neuropathy, and in severe cases, it may even cause irreversible nerve damage.</p><h4>2. Anemia 💉</h4><p>Vitamin B12 is an essential nutrient for red blood cell formation. When deficient, it easily leads to megaloblastic anemia, manifested as fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, etc., which greatly affects the patient's quality of life.</p><h4>3. Decline in immune function 🦠</h4><p>Vitamin B12 deficiency may also affect the immune system, causing a decline in the patient's immunity and making them more susceptible to diseases. Especially during the postoperative recovery period, low immunity may delay the body's self - repair process.</p><h3>🧑‍⚕️ Treatment and supplementation measures</h3><p>Although vitamin B12 deficiency after sleeve gastrectomy cannot be completely avoided, patients can effectively manage this risk through regular examinations and appropriate supplementation.</p><h4>1. Regular monitoring of vitamin B12 levels</h4><p>Patients after surgery need to regularly test the vitamin B12 level in their blood to detect deficiency problems in a timely manner.</p><h4>2. Oral or injectable supplementation</h4><p>Once vitamin B12 deficiency is detected, doctors usually recommend that patients be treated with oral supplements or injections.</p><h4>3. Dietary adjustment</h4><p>Patients should pay attention to consuming foods rich in vitamin B12, such as meat, fish, dairy products, and eggs. Vegetarian patients or those unable to meet their needs through food may require additional supplementation.</p><h3>⚖️ Summary:</h3><p>Although sleeve gastrectomy can help patients achieve significant weight - loss results, the long - term risk of vitamin B12 deficiency cannot be ignored. If not supplemented in time, it may lead to health problems such as nervous system damage, anemia, and a decline in immune function. Therefore, patients undergoing surgical weight loss need to closely monitor their vitamin B12 levels while losing weight and supplement under the guidance of a doctor to ensure their physical health. Healthy weight loss is not just about reducing the number on the scale; more importantly, it is about long - term physical and mental health. Monitoring and supplementing vitamin B12 are indispensable parts after surgery. When making a decision on surgical weight loss, be sure to consider these long - term health impacts and conduct comprehensive postoperative management and monitoring.</p></div>
