    <div id="article-description"><p>😵‍💫 Workplace Burnout and Quiet Quitting: Are You Just Hanging On?</p><h3>Xiaolin's Story</h3><p>The first thing Xiaolin does when she wakes up every morning is to wonder if she can take a day off. Meetings are scheduled from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., and there are always 99+ unread messages on WeChat. Overtime is not only the norm but also the default. The job she once loved now only brings her numbness. She doesn't quit, nor does she complain to her boss. Instead, she chooses to "do what's required and nothing more", which is what we call "Quiet Quitting".</p><h3>📌 What is Quiet Quitting?</h3><p>Quiet Quitting is not about leaving the job. It's an emotional detachment. Employees, without violating their duties, only do the minimum amount of work, no longer take on extra responsibilities voluntarily, and stop "giving their all" for work. It's a self - protection mechanism for many workers facing "job burnout".</p><h3>🔥 What is Job Burnout (Burnout)?</h3><p>Job burnout is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion caused by long - term stress. Common manifestations include:</p><ul><li>😓 Feeling completely drained, even having trouble getting out of bed in the morning.</li><li>😠 Having negative emotions or being indifferent towards work.</li><li>🤯 Experiencing a drop in efficiency, struggling to complete even small tasks.</li><li>🤐 Being reluctant to communicate, becoming silent or withdrawn.</li></ul><h3>📊 🔍 Job Burnout Self - Assessment Scale (Brief Version of Maslach Burnout Inventory)</h3><p>The following questions can help you initially assess whether you have job burnout (score each question from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating more severe burnout):</p><table><tr><th>Question</th><th>Scoring Range</th></tr><tr><td>I feel completely exhausted.</td><td>1 - 5</td></tr><tr><td>I have no interest in my work.</td><td>1 - 5</td></tr><tr><td>I often doubt if I'm suitable for this job.</td><td>1 - 5</td></tr><tr><td>I have less and less patience with colleagues and customers.</td><td>1 - 5</td></tr><tr><td>I feel "numb".</td><td>1 - 5</td></tr><tr><td>I'm getting slower at completing tasks.</td><td>1 - 5</td></tr></table><p>If your total score is ≥ 20 points: It is recommended that you pay attention to your mental health, make timely adjustments, or seek professional support.</p><h3>🧠 Can You Take a Mental Health Sick Leave? How to Apply?</h3><p>Of course! Mental health is also an important part of overall health.</p><p>📍 Steps for application:</p><ol><li>Visit a doctor: Go to a psychiatry, psychology department, or a psychological counseling clinic first to get a professional diagnosis, such as anxiety, depression, or adjustment disorder.</li><li>Get a diagnosis certificate: The doctor can issue a certificate recommending rest based on your condition.</li><li>Follow the leave - taking process: Submit the application according to your company's sick - leave procedure. Legally, mental illnesses are entitled to sick leave just like other physical illnesses.</li><li>Don't feel ashamed: Mental health issues are like a cold or fever, not a sign of "weakness".</li></ol><h3>🧪 🔄 The Effect of the Four - Day Work Week Experiment: Can It Really Solve Burnout?</h3><p>In recent years, many countries around the world have experimented with the four - day work week. Data shows that:</p><ul><li>✅ Productivity has not declined; in fact, it has even increased (people are more focused).</li><li>✅ Employees' happiness has increased, and the turnover rate has decreased.</li><li>✅ Mental health has improved significantly.</li><li>❗ However, some positions (such as those in the service industry and customer service) still face implementation difficulties.</li><li>🔁 Many pilot countries (such as Iceland and some Japanese companies) are promoting the transformation of the four - day work week into an official system.</li></ul><h3>💡 Tips for Coping with Burnout:</h3><ol><li>Set boundaries: Don't reply to work - related messages after work, and disconnect on weekends.</li><li>Don't push yourself too hard: Your body and mind are your most important assets. Take time off and rest when needed.</li><li>Practice mindfulness: Activities like meditation, deep breathing, and writing gratitude journals are proven effective ways to reduce stress.</li><li>Learn to say "no": Don't work unnecessary overtime and don't take on tasks that are not your responsibility.</li><li>Seek support: Talking to friends or seeking psychological counseling are good ways to relieve stress.</li></ol><h3>💬 In Conclusion:</h3><p>In an era where the "workaholic" culture prevails, choosing not to over - exhaust yourself is a kind of bravery. Remember, work is just a part of life, and you are the protagonist of your life. 🌷</p></div>
