        "content": "<p>&ldquo;My daughter grabs her phone to scroll through TikTok as soon as she gets home from school. Her mood has been getting worse and she often hides in her room and cries.&rdquo; This is a parent's outpouring in a psychological counseling room.</p><p>In today's fast - paced and high - demand modern society, the incidence of mental problems among teenagers is increasing year by year. Don't think that &ldquo;kids have no troubles&rdquo;. Their world also has an inexpressible heaviness.</p><p>In the past few years, terms like &ldquo;teenage depression&rdquo;, &ldquo;campus anxiety&rdquo;, and &ldquo;teenage self - harm&rdquo; have frequently appeared on the hot search lists, attracting the attention of the whole society. In 2023, multiple states in the United States officially sued social platforms such as Meta and TikTok, alleging that these platforms' &ldquo;addictive algorithms&rdquo; have seriously damaged the mental health of teenagers. This lawsuit is not an accident but just the tip of the iceberg.</p><h3>🎯 Three Core Issues, Not to Be Ignored!</h3><h4>1⃣ Social Media Anxiety: Likes as the Yardstick of &ldquo;Self - Worth&rdquo;</h4><p>Hot search terms: &ldquo;TikTok causes depression&rdquo;, &ldquo;social platform anxiety disorder&rdquo;. Nowadays, children almost all have mobile phones starting from primary school. In the ocean of Instagram, TikTok, and Xiaohongshu, they are surrounded by a sea of &ldquo;perfect lives&rdquo; and &ldquo;flawless personas&rdquo; every day. It's easy for them to fall into self - doubt, thinking, &ldquo;Why am I not as good as others?&rdquo;</p><p>Teenagers are in a critical stage of self - identity development. When they use the number of &ldquo;likes&rdquo; and &ldquo;followers&rdquo; as a measure of self - worth, inner emptiness and anxiety follow. Data shows that there is a significant positive correlation between the frequency of social media use and symptoms of depression and anxiety.</p><p>📌 Typical symptoms: Obsessed with short - video scrolling, frequent selfies, overly concerned about comments and likes, self - denial, irritability, and easy crying.</p><h4>2⃣ Overwhelming Academic Pressure: Exams as the &ldquo;Only Way Out&rdquo;</h4><p>&ldquo;I'm not studying for my dreams but to avoid being left behind.&rdquo; This is the true feeling of many children. The competition for grades, contests, and resumes has made the anxiety of &ldquo;falling behind if not working hard&rdquo; go beyond just learning. Parents are anxious, teachers are anxious, and the whole society is anxious. This anxiety spreads like an infectious disease into every classroom and family.</p><p>Especially with the huge pressure of high - school entrance exams, college entrance exams, and studying abroad, many teenagers show obvious anxiety, sleep disorders, and may even develop school aversion and self - harm behaviors.</p><p>📌 Typical symptoms: Lack of motivation to study, declining grades, persistent insomnia, physical symptoms (headaches, stomachaches), and feeling confused about the future.</p><h4>3⃣ Surge in Self - Harm Behaviors: Misplaced Emotional Outlets</h4><p>Some self - inflicted wounds are not for attention but to make the pain &ldquo;visible&rdquo;. According to World Health Organization data, the incidence of self - harm among teenagers aged 15 to 19 is rising, especially among girls.</p><p>Self - harm doesn't necessarily mean suicidal intent. Often, it's the only &ldquo;outlet&rdquo; they find when under extreme pressure and emotional breakdown. Misleading &ldquo;glorifying content&rdquo; about self - harm on social media, such as &ldquo;self - harm challenges&rdquo; and &ldquo;scar displays&rdquo;, makes some teenagers think it's a trendy way to vent.</p><p>📌 Warning signs: Always wearing long sleeves, having scratches on the body, abnormal behavior, avoiding people, and being less sensitive to pain.</p><h3>💼 Real - Life Case: US Lawsuit Against Social Platforms</h3><p>In 2023, 33 states in the United States jointly filed a class - action lawsuit against Meta and TikTok's parent company. The lawsuit stated that &ldquo;the platforms know their content will exacerbate teenage addiction and cause anxiety and depression, but still prioritize commercial interests over user health.&rdquo;</p><p>The lawsuit cited numerous cases of teenage self - harm, anxiety, and even suicide. Some children joined so - called &ldquo;weight - loss groups&rdquo; on TikTok and finally developed severe anorexia; some chose to end their lives due to cyberbullying. This incident has sounded the global alarm: Do we really understand our children's world? Are we really listening to their emotions?</p><h3>🛡️ What Should Parents and Schools Do?</h3><p>🔑 The key is not to prevent but to guide!</p><h4>✅ One: Create an Open and Warm Family Atmosphere</h4><p>Children are not machines or exam - taking tools. They need someone to talk to, not parents who only say, &ldquo;You should strive for success.&rdquo; Try to replace &ldquo;Why are you so stupid?&rdquo; with &ldquo;I care about how you feel.&rdquo;</p><h4>✅ Two: Stay Aware of the Online World</h4><p>Parents don't need to completely ban the Internet. Instead, they should &ldquo;participate together&rdquo;: understand what their children are watching, discuss whether the content of short - videos is real and healthy, recommend positive and interesting accounts, and make a &ldquo;screen - time plan&rdquo; with their children.</p><h4>✅ Three: Start Emotional Education Early</h4><p>🔑 Emotional management should not start only when problems occur. Children should learn from an early age: recognize emotions (e.g., this is anxiety, not &ldquo;I'm a failure&rdquo;), accept emotions (emotions are not enemies but reminders), and express emotions (such as through painting, writing a diary, or exercising instead of suppressing or exploding).</p><p>💬 Recommended books: <i>I and My Little Monster Emotions</i>, <i>Imperfection Is Beautiful</i>.</p><p>📱 Recommended apps: Forest (to help with concentration), breathing training apps, and children's meditation apps.</p><h3>🌈 Conclusion: Provide a Mental &ldquo;Umbrella&rdquo; for Children Together</h3><p>Adolescence is not a smooth journey, but with companionship, teenagers can overcome any difficulties. Don't let children face an emotional world they can't understand alone. A hug from parents, an affirmation from teachers, or a listening ear from peers may be the light that helps them through the dark times.</p><p>🕊️ May every child have a healthy mind and confidently move towards tomorrow.</p>"

        "date": "2025-04-12",
        "content": "<p>😵‍💫 Workplace Burnout and Quiet Quitting: Are You Just Hanging On?</p><h3>Xiaolin's Story</h3><p>The first thing Xiaolin does when she wakes up every morning is to wonder if she can take a day off. Meetings are scheduled from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., and there are always 99+ unread messages on WeChat. Overtime is not only the norm but also the default. The job she once loved now only brings her numbness. She doesn't quit, nor does she complain to her boss. Instead, she chooses to \"do what's required and nothing more\", which is what we call \"Quiet Quitting\".</p><h3>📌 What is Quiet Quitting?</h3><p>Quiet Quitting is not about leaving the job. It's an emotional detachment. Employees, without violating their duties, only do the minimum amount of work, no longer take on extra responsibilities voluntarily, and stop \"giving their all\" for work. It's a self - protection mechanism for many workers facing \"job burnout\".</p><h3>🔥 What is Job Burnout (Burnout)?</h3><p>Job burnout is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion caused by long - term stress. Common manifestations include:</p><ul><li>😓 Feeling completely drained, even having trouble getting out of bed in the morning.</li><li>😠 Having negative emotions or being indifferent towards work.</li><li>🤯 Experiencing a drop in efficiency, struggling to complete even small tasks.</li><li>🤐 Being reluctant to communicate, becoming silent or withdrawn.</li></ul><h3>📊 🔍 Job Burnout Self - Assessment Scale (Brief Version of Maslach Burnout Inventory)</h3><p>The following questions can help you initially assess whether you have job burnout (score each question from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating more severe burnout):</p><table><tr><th>Question</th><th>Scoring Range</th></tr><tr><td>I feel completely exhausted.</td><td>1 - 5</td></tr><tr><td>I have no interest in my work.</td><td>1 - 5</td></tr><tr><td>I often doubt if I'm suitable for this job.</td><td>1 - 5</td></tr><tr><td>I have less and less patience with colleagues and customers.</td><td>1 - 5</td></tr><tr><td>I feel \"numb\".</td><td>1 - 5</td></tr><tr><td>I'm getting slower at completing tasks.</td><td>1 - 5</td></tr></table><p>If your total score is ≥ 20 points: It is recommended that you pay attention to your mental health, make timely adjustments, or seek professional support.</p><h3>🧠 Can You Take a Mental Health Sick Leave? How to Apply?</h3><p>Of course! Mental health is also an important part of overall health.</p><p>📍 Steps for application:</p><ol><li>Visit a doctor: Go to a psychiatry, psychology department, or a psychological counseling clinic first to get a professional diagnosis, such as anxiety, depression, or adjustment disorder.</li><li>Get a diagnosis certificate: The doctor can issue a certificate recommending rest based on your condition.</li><li>Follow the leave - taking process: Submit the application according to your company's sick - leave procedure. Legally, mental illnesses are entitled to sick leave just like other physical illnesses.</li><li>Don't feel ashamed: Mental health issues are like a cold or fever, not a sign of \"weakness\".</li></ol><h3>🧪 🔄 The Effect of the Four - Day Work Week Experiment: Can It Really Solve Burnout?</h3><p>In recent years, many countries around the world have experimented with the four - day work week. Data shows that:</p><ul><li>✅ Productivity has not declined; in fact, it has even increased (people are more focused).</li><li>✅ Employees' happiness has increased, and the turnover rate has decreased.</li><li>✅ Mental health has improved significantly.</li><li>❗ However, some positions (such as those in the service industry and customer service) still face implementation difficulties.</li><li>🔁 Many pilot countries (such as Iceland and some Japanese companies) are promoting the transformation of the four - day work week into an official system.</li></ul><h3>💡 Tips for Coping with Burnout:</h3><ol><li>Set boundaries: Don't reply to work - related messages after work, and disconnect on weekends.</li><li>Don't push yourself too hard: Your body and mind are your most important assets. Take time off and rest when needed.</li><li>Practice mindfulness: Activities like meditation, deep breathing, and writing gratitude journals are proven effective ways to reduce stress.</li><li>Learn to say \"no\": Don't work unnecessary overtime and don't take on tasks that are not your responsibility.</li><li>Seek support: Talking to friends or seeking psychological counseling are good ways to relieve stress.</li></ol><h3>💬 In Conclusion:</h3><p>In an era where the \"workaholic\" culture prevails, choosing not to over - exhaust yourself is a kind of bravery. Remember, work is just a part of life, and you are the protagonist of your life. 🌷</p>"

        "image": "images/3.png",
        "date": "2025-04-12",
        "content": "<p>🌍 Eating alone, watching shows alone, scrolling through your phone, but not knowing who to talk to? Although we scroll through our friends' circles every day, chat in groups non - stop, and are often \"online\", our hearts feel emptier? Even when surrounded by people, do we still feel like an \"invisible person\"?</p><p>This is not just an emotional \"whim\". It's a health hazard spreading globally - \"loneliness\".</p><h3>📉 Loneliness: Becoming an \"Epidemic\"</h3><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has officially listed loneliness as a global public health threat. Surprising, right? But the data speaks for itself:</p><ul><li>A quarter of the world's elderly admit to often feeling lonely.</li><li>Young people are not spared either: Those aged 18 - 24 are the loneliest generation.</li><li>The long - term effects of loneliness can be as harmful to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.</li><li>Lonely people have a significantly higher risk of diseases such as heart disease, Alzheimer's, and depression than non - lonely people.</li></ul><p>In the UK, data shows that over 9 million people often feel lonely, many of whom are young people and the elderly living alone. In Japan, loneliness has even led to the social phenomenon of \"lonely death\" (kodokushi). This \"loneliness epidemic\" is spreading rapidly among the younger generation, especially those living alone, relying on online platforms for socializing, and lacking in - depth connections in a fast - paced life. Former US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy once warned: \"Loneliness is like a silent plague, eroding our health, well - being, and even the social fabric.\"</p><h3>🧠 How Does Loneliness Harm Our Brain and Body?</h3><p>Loneliness is not just an emotional issue. It has a profound impact on physical health and brain structure:</p><ul><li>It increases the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a weakened immune system.</li><li>It raises the probability of developing depression, anxiety, and Alzheimer's disease.</li><li>Lonely people perform significantly worse in cognitive function tests than those who are socially active.</li></ul><p>Psychologists believe that loneliness puts people in a \"defensive state\", leading to a chronic stress response: continuous secretion of adrenaline, poor sleep quality, and an increase in negative emotions. Over time, both the body and mind become exhausted.</p><h3>💡 The UK's \"Social Prescribing for Loneliness\": The Government Takes Action!</h3><p>The UK is the first country to elevate the issue of \"loneliness\" to a national strategic level and even established a \"Minister for Loneliness\".</p><p>Their approach is called Social Prescribing. Simply put, doctors not only prescribe medicine but also \"social activities\":</p><ul><li>🧩 For example, they may advise patients to join a choir, a gardening class, a book club, or community volunteer services.</li><li>🎯 The government also mandates community participation and establishes \"social contact points\" to encourage lonely people to leave their homes and reintegrate into society.</li></ul><p>This kind of \"intervention\" has shown obvious effects in reducing the frequency of chronic and mental diseases.</p><h3>❤️ What Can We Do? - Start with \"Companionship\"</h3><p>In an era of highly developed technology and information interconnection, the essence of loneliness is not the lack of people but the lack of understanding. Sometimes, just one small thing can change a person's sense of loneliness. Each of us is part of the antidote to loneliness:</p><ul><li>👥 Maintain real connections: Don't just like posts on the friend circle. Make more phone calls and arrange face - to - face meetings.<ul><li>Send a message to a friend you haven't contacted for a long time.</li><li>Have more in - depth conversations with your parents instead of just asking \"Have you eaten?\"</li></ul></li><li>🌱 Cultivate hobbies: Join interest groups or study circles. It's not just about killing time but creating resonance.<ul><li>Actively participate in an offline book club, a yoga class, or a community volunteer activity.</li></ul></li><li>🧘‍♀️ Pay attention to inner feelings: Writing a diary, meditating, and psychological counseling are all ways to release emotions.</li><li>🤝 Be kind to others and yourself: Each of us may be the \"medicine\" in someone else's \"social prescription\".<ul><li>If you feel lonely, open your heart to others. Don't be afraid of \"bothering\" them.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>🧸 A Gentle Reminder:</h3><p>Loneliness is not shameful, nor is it a sign of weakness. It's not scary either; it's just a part of human emotions. What's scary is our indifference. It's like water, accumulating drop by drop, and may eventually empty a person's body and mind. Humans are social animals, and the desire for connection is in our nature. When you find yourself in a low mood, less willing to go out, and speaking less, maybe you're not \"lazy\", but \"loneliness\" is quietly taking over. Don't bear it alone. Step out, and the world is waiting for you to \"restart\" your connections.</p>"

        "date": "2025-04-12",
        "content": "<p>Today, let's talk about a psychological topic that's getting hotter and more controversial among young people: the controversy over anxiety disorder and overdiagnosis.</p><h3>📱 #MentalHealth: When \"Anxiety\" Goes Viral on TikTok</h3><p>In recent years, \"anxiety disorder\" is no longer an obscure medical term. Especially on social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, the number of video contents under the hashtags #Anxiety and #MentalHealth has skyrocketed.</p><p>💡 Interesting data:</p><ul><li>The view count of the #Anxiety tag on TikTok has exceeded 20 billion.</li><li>A large number of content creators share their \"anxiety experiences\", psychological assessments, and the process of using medications.</li><li>Some short - videos encourage viewers to self - diagnose based on \"symptom lists\" and infer whether they need medication or treatment on their own.</li></ul><h3>😬 Phenomenon: Is Anxiety Being \"Misused\"?</h3><p>After watching these videos, many young people left messages in the comment section: \"I always thought it was just my personality problem. It turns out I have an anxiety disorder!\"</p><p>It may seem like an awakening of psychological awareness, but it has also raised questions in the medical community - \"Are these videos turning normal emotional fluctuations into 'diseases'?\"</p><p>Medical professionals are worried that social platforms are giving rise to a culture of \"psychological disorder name identification\". People use labels like \"anxiety\", \"social phobia\", and \"ADHD\" to define themselves, ignoring the seriousness of diagnosis and medical standards.</p><h3>💊 Is Anxiety Being \"Over - Medicalized\"?</h3><p>This is one of the biggest controversies at present, especially focusing on the relationship between \"pharmaceutical companies\" and the \"expansion of the definition of mental illness\".</p><p>📚 A review of the background:</p><ul><li>Over the past few decades, the definition of anxiety - related disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) has gradually expanded.</li><li>Previously, only severe patients with \"anxiety disorders\" were defined as such. Now, phenomena like daily nervousness, test anxiety, and social avoidance may also be classified as \"symptoms\".</li><li>Meanwhile, the anti - anxiety drug market has expanded rapidly, with a global market value of over billions of dollars.</li></ul><p>🎯 Some people hold the view that:</p><p>\"Not every emotional distress requires drug treatment. Pharmaceutical companies are expanding their consumer market through 'overdiagnosis'.\"</p><h3>⚖️ Disagreements in the Medical Community</h3><p>🩺 One school of thought believes that:</p><ul><li>Diseases like depression and anxiety are easily overlooked in the early stages. \"Expanding the definition\" helps the public pay more attention.</li><li>More and more young people are willing to face up to psychological problems, which is a positive development.</li></ul><p>🧠 The other school of thought refutes:</p><ul><li>Quickly \"labeling\" normal emotional ups and downs actually reduces the attention on real patients.</li><li>Abusing drugs may lead to drug dependence, side effects, and even the worsening of symptoms.</li><li>\"Disease - naming\" may actually increase anxiety - \"I'm just a bit stressed. Do I really have a disease?\"</li></ul><h3>🧭 How to View \"Anxiety\" Rationally?</h3><ol><li>Don't self - diagnose based solely on online content. Videos, assessment forms, and jokes are not equivalent to medical diagnoses. Consult a professional psychologist when you feel unwell.</li><li>Emotions are not equal to diseases. Everyone experiences anxiety, nervousness, and insomnia at times. Not every emotion represents an illness.</li><li>Medical intervention does not equal drug treatment. Treating anxiety does not necessarily mean taking medicine. Psychological counseling, cognitive - behavioral therapy (CBT), meditation, and exercise are all first - line recommended therapies.</li><li>Beware of the self - limitation brought by the \"label culture\". Recognize your own problems instead of being confined by the \"disease name\".</li></ol><h3>💬 Summary & A Gentle Reminder:</h3><p>Anxiety is not a trendy label, nor is every moment of unease a \"disease\" that needs to be suppressed by drugs. We should face up to mental health, but also reject hasty diagnoses and over - medication. May you be brave, clear - headed, and gentle with yourself when facing stress.</p>"

        "content": "<p>👋 Hi, I'm the global insight officer of the PeaceLove era! Today, let's talk about a modern phenomenon that is quietly changing our brains and lifestyles - Digital Detox and Screen Addiction 📱🧠</p><h3>📲 Trend</h3><p>On average, modern people spend over 4 hours a day looking at their phones, and the situation is even worse among the young. Some studies show that some teenagers touch their screens more than 2,600 times a day. We are not \"using our phones\"; instead, we are being used by them. Especially the instant dopamine rewards brought by short - videos, likes, and push notifications can form a \"mini - addiction\" circuit in our brains. Over time, our attention, memory, and emotional regulation abilities are all being depleted.</p><h3>🧠 Scientific Warning: 'Information Overload' is Really Harming Your Brain</h3><p>Neuroscientists point out that long - term information intake and rapid attention switching (such as swiping short - videos and jumping between multiple apps) can lead to:</p><ul><li>Decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex (responsible for focus and control)</li><li>Decline in working memory ability</li><li>Emotional regulation disorders</li><li>Severely impaired sleep quality</li></ul><p>🔬 Multiple experiments have found that after participants are exposed to social media pushes or frequently swipe short - videos, there are significant changes in their brain structures. This is not just psychological anxiety but also \"physiological brain fatigue\".</p><h3>🌿 Thus, 'Digital Detox' has Become a New Trend</h3><h4>✈️ The Rise of Phone - Free Vacation Camps</h4><p>For example:</p><ul><li>In the UK, there is the 'Unplugged' project, where tourists hand in their phones and stay in forest cabins without Wi - Fi.</li><li>Silicon Valley engineers in the US often participate in 7 - day camps featuring 'quiet meditation + digital silence'.</li><li>In China, there are also 'electronic device storage services' that offer a 'back - to - basics' lifestyle experience.</li></ul><p>The goal of these activities is to temporarily disconnect from the Internet and regain the 'idle' state of the brain.</p><h3>🔥 Hot Search Keywords: 'Guide to Dopamine Detox' & 'Phone Jail'</h3><p>Social media is also fighting back:</p><ul><li>'Dopamine Detox' encourages people to avoid all instant - gratification activities (watching shows, eating sweets, using social apps, etc.) for one day or one week to reset the pleasure system.</li><li>'Phone Jail' has become a hit among office workers and parents, using timed locks to force people to stay away from their phones.</li><li>Various 'focus apps' are also becoming popular, such as Forest and the Pomodoro Technique, which help people control their phone - using time.</li></ul><h3>🙋 Do We Really Need Digital Detox?</h3><p>The answer is yes. But digital detox does not mean avoiding technology. It is a lifestyle that allows us to regain control of our rhythm and choose how we consume information.</p><p>👉 Signs that you may need a 'detox' include:</p><ul><li>You always swipe your phone until the early hours before going to bed.</li><li>You feel anxious if you don't look at your phone for a minute.</li><li>You keep opening the message interface even though you know there are no notifications.</li><li>The first thing you do when you wake up is pick up your phone.</li><li>You can't focus on work or study for more than 20 minutes.</li></ul><h3>🛠️ A Simple Guide to 'Digital Detox' for Beginners</h3><ol><li>Set a daily 'off - grid time', such as one hour before bedtime or not touching your phone during meals.</li><li>Set screen - time limits. Both iPhones and Android phones have built - in'screen time' management features.</li><li>Use the 'black - and - white mode' to reduce the attractiveness of your phone. Turn your screen gray to reduce the desire to swipe.</li><li>Use a physical alarm clock instead of your phone to avoid being pulled into work - related anxiety by morning messages.</li><li>Arrange offline activities, such as reading, exercising, cooking, and socializing - give your brain a 'low - stimulation but high - nutrition' experience.</li></ol><h3>🧘‍♀️ Conclusion and a Gentle Reminder</h3><p>Our brains have limits. They were not designed to be connected to the Internet 24/7. Digital detox is not against technology; it is about recalibrating the relationship between humans and information. Why not give yourself a chance to turn off the screen and feel the long - lost calm and clarity? 🌿📵</p>"

This dose does not cause obvious \"hallucinogenic\" experiences but is said to improve mood, creativity, focus, and even treat mental illnesses.</p><h3>🚀 Breakthroughs: Magic Mushroom Treatment for Depression and PTSD Enters Legalization Pilot</h3><h4>✅ Canada</h4><ul><li>Since 2020, Health Canada has allowed some terminally ill patients to use psilocybin under psychological counseling.</li><li>In clinical trials, over 70% of patients with treatment - resistant depression showed significant improvement in symptoms after using it.</li></ul><h4>✅ Australia</h4><ul><li>Since 2023, it has become the world's first country to approve psychedelic drugs as legal prescription drugs.</li><li>Psychiatrists can use psilocybin to treat depression and PTSD under strict supervision.</li><li>Meanwhile, MDMA has also been approved for the treatment of severe trauma.</li></ul><p>These breakthroughs are supported by an increasing number of neuroimaging studies: Psilocybin can \"restart\" the brain regions related to emotional regulation, helping patients break out of negative thinking loops and producing weeks - long mood improvement.</p><h3>🎯 Potential Efficacy of Microdosing (Under Research)</h3><ul><li>🧠 Improve mood and well - being</li><li>🎨 Stimulate creativity and inspiration</li><li>🧘 Relieve chronic mental illnesses such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD</li><li>🔁 Change the brain's \"default mode network\" (DMN), helping people break out of the cycle of excessive introspection and anxiety</li></ul><h3>⚠️ Risks and Controversies: \"Black - Market Psychedelics\" and Safety Hazards</h3><p>Despite the continuous progress of legalization, microdosing psychedelics still pose the following major risks:</p><h4>❌ Black - Market Abuse</h4><ul><li>Some people buy psilocybin or LSD through non - formal channels, with unknown dosages and complex ingredients.</li><li>There have been cases in North America where psychedelics contaminated with fentanyl led to death, causing an uproar in public opinion.</li><li>Some people develop hallucinatory anxiety, sensory confusion, or even show signs of schizophrenia after long - term microdosing.</li></ul><h4>❌ Higher Risks for People with Mental Illnesses</h4><ul><li>People with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder may experience severe episodes if they take these substances without permission.</li><li>Clinical studies emphasize that professional psychological support and environmental management are essential; otherwise, the consequences can be uncontrollable.</li></ul><h4>❌ Legal Gray Areas</h4><ul><li>Although some countries have started the legalization process, most regions still consider these substances \"controlled drugs\", and their possession and use are illegal.</li><li>The prevalence of commercial hype and online \"spiritual healing camps\" has also deviated public perception from the scientific track.</li></ul><h3>🧪 So, is microdosing psychedelics a healing miracle or a dangerous edge?</h3><p>It can be both a cure and a poison, depending on:</p><ul><li>📍 Whether it is used under the guidance of a professional psychologist.</li><li>⚖️ Whether there is legal and clear dosage and environmental control.</li><li>🧠 Whether there is a real assessment and follow - up of mental state.</li><li>📚 Whether it is based on scientific research rather than following online folk remedies blindly.</li></ul><h3>🧭 Summary and Reminder</h3><p>Microdosing psychedelics treatment is a great hope for future psychiatry, but it is not a panacea. It can only be a tool in a serious medical system and should not be blindly imitated without supervision and science. 🌱 If you or someone around you is experiencing anxiety, depression, or trauma, seeking formal psychological counseling and psychiatric help is the safest and most effective first step. Don't let the \"spiritual craze\" on social media overshadow the science and risks in reality.</p>"

        "content": "<p>Today, let's talk about a topic that has been extremely popular in psychology, neuroscience, and social media in recent years - **Generational Trauma** 🧬💔</p><h3>🌪 What is Generational Trauma?</h3><p>Generational trauma, also known as transgenerational trauma, refers to the situation where an individual has not personally experienced a certain major trauma but bears the 'after - effects' of the sufferings endured by their predecessors at the psychological or physiological level. These traumas include:</p><ul><li>Historical disasters such as wars, genocides, slavery, and forced migrations</li><li>Family traumas such as domestic violence, sexual assault, alcoholism, and suicide</li><li>Social oppressions such as long - term poverty, discrimination, and marginalization</li></ul><h3>🧬 Scientific Research: Can Trauma be 'Engraved' on Gene Expression?</h3><p>Recent epigenetic studies have found that major traumatic events can change the way human genes are expressed, and these expression mechanisms can be passed on to future generations. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li>💣 The study of the 'Dutch Winter Famine': Children born to mothers who experienced famine during pregnancy had a significantly higher incidence of diabetes, depression, and obesity in adulthood.</li><li>🕍 Descendants of Holocaust survivors: A US study found that their stress - hormone cortisol levels were disordered, and they were more sensitive to anxiety and trauma.</li><li>🧕 Syrian refugee children: Research shows that even if they are born in a stable environment, they may exhibit symptoms such as panic, hyper - vigilance, and adjustment disorders.</li></ul><p>📌 The key point is: it's not about 'inheriting' the trauma, but 'transmitting' the adaptation patterns and physiological imprints of the trauma.</p><h3>💔 Cultural Phenomenon: #ParentingCycleBreak</h3><p>On social media, more and more young people are using the #ParentingCycleBreak hashtag, indicating that they want to actively recognize and end the emotional scars and parenting styles inherited from the previous generation. Common goals include:</p><ul><li>🧱 Reject 'demolishing parenting' (not allowing crying or showing weakness)</li><li>🪞 Learn to express and accept emotions (instead of inter - generational silence)</li><li>💬 Initiate family conversations and tell untold trauma stories</li><li>🧠 Actively seek psychotherapy and family therapy to break the 'inter - generational cycle'</li></ul><p>📲 You may have also come across content like this:</p><ul><li>\"My mother always equated love with control. I don't want to treat my children that way.\"</li><li>\"No one in my family ever said 'I love you'. Now I say it three times a day.\"</li></ul><h3>🧠 Why are 'Awareness' and 'Expression' the Keys?</h3><p>Psychologists point out that unexpressed emotions do not disappear but are passed on inter - generationally in the form of trauma. If parents have not dealt with their own traumas, they may unconsciously:</p><ul><li>Practice emotional avoidance (silence, indifference)</li><li>Exercise emotional control (humiliation, suppression)</li><li>Replicate behaviors (violence, over - protection)</li></ul><p>Children growing up in such an environment may develop traits such as anxiety, self - denial, excessive people - pleasing, and suppressed anger.</p><h3>🛠 How to Break the Cycle of Generational Trauma?</h3><ul><li>✔️ Acknowledge and name the trauma: Stop avoiding the unspoken events in family history.</li><li>✔️ Create a safe emotional space: Practice emotional expression rather than suppression in the family.</li><li>✔️ Seek professional help: Family therapy and individual psychological counseling are effective intervention methods.</li><li>✔️ Write and tell family stories: Turn silence into narration and let memories release emotions.</li><li>✔️ Be an 'awakened parent': Start changing from yourself and let the next generation grow freely.</li></ul><h3>💡 Summary in One Sentence:</h3><p>We can be the end of the pain or the beginning of the healing. You don't have to inherit everything; you can choose to end it. #ParentingCycleBreak is not a negation of the previous generation but a brave act of healing.</p>"

It's not about school admissions or the rat - race, but rather, \"How much longer can the Earth survive?\"</p><p>📊 According to a Lancet survey covering 10 countries, 75% of teenagers said they \"fear for the future\", and 56% believed that \"humanity is doomed\".

It not only concerns the transformation of the future mental - health industry but also affects the trust and safety of every user who clicks on an AI chatbox late at night.</p><h3>🤖 Why has AI entered psychological services?</h3><p>With the surge in mental - health needs, traditional psychological counseling can't meet the demand. So, AI has been widely introduced into psychological - service scenarios:</p><ul><li>Emotional - companion robots: such as intelligent voice assistants with empathetic response capabilities</li><li>AI psychological assessment systems: quickly judge emotional states or tendencies towards anxiety/depression</li><li>Virtual psychological - counseling assistants: open 24/7, low - cost, and offer a stronger sense of privacy</li><li>Large models like ChatGPT are used to simulate 'counseling conversations' to relieve users' immediate emotions</li></ul><p>This trend has improved the accessibility of psychological services on the one hand, but also planted many ethical hidden dangers on the other.</p><h3>⚠️ Controversial cases that sparked the debate</h3><h4>1. AI misdiagnosis of suicide risk</h4><p>When a user expressed negative emotions during an AI chat, the system failed to recognize the suicide risk in time and even replied in a 'casual' tone, which ultimately led to a tragedy.</p><p>👉 The problem lies in that AI lacks humans' 'emotional perception radar' and emergency - response mechanisms.</p><h4>2. User - privacy leakage scandal</h4><p>Some psychological AI platforms didn't encrypt users' chat records. The background even tagged'sensitive content' for algorithm training without users' knowledge.</p><p>👉 Once private emotional data is leaked, the consequences can be as serious as a medical accident.</p><h4>3. Can AI replace psychologists? Is the 'calm' AI safe enough?</h4><p>Although AI never gets tired and is unbiased, it doesn't have 'human - like empathy' and 'dynamic judgment'. When dealing with complex trauma, gender - based or domestic - violence cases, AI is likely to underestimate risks, misjudge semantics, or ignore cultural - background differences.</p><h3>🧭 Ethical dilemmas of AI psychological services</h3><table><thead><tr><th>Controversial focus</th><th>Ethical challenges</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>🔍 Identification errors</td><td>AI can't accurately identify high - risk signals such as self - harm and suicide</td></tr><tr><td>🔒 Privacy protection</td><td>Do users' 'confessions' to AI also enjoy doctor - patient confidentiality rights?</td></tr><tr><td>🤖 Emotional authenticity</td><td>Is AI 'empathy' a simulation or a disguise? Will it cause dependence?</td></tr><tr><td>⚖️ Liability attribution</td><td>If AI advice causes harm, who is responsible - the programmer, the company, or the platform?</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>📌 What are the real - world protective mechanisms doing?</h3><p>🌐 Regulatory efforts are gradually catching up around the world:</p><ul><li>🇺🇸 The American Psychological Association suggests that AI should not be used as a 'formal psychological - intervention tool' unless supervised by human professionals.</li><li>🇬🇧 The UK's NHS stipulates that AI health assistants can only be used as 'auxiliary means' and cannot independently make diagnostic conclusions.</li><li>🇨🇳 Many domestic AI psychological products have been ordered to make rectifications to fill in the 'compliance gaps' such as data encryption and user - informed consent forms.</li></ul><h3>🔐 How should we deal with AI psychological services?</h3><p>💡 Some suggestions for users:</p><ol><li>Define the boundaries: AI can listen, accompany, and comfort, but it can't replace professional treatment.</li><li>Detect risks: If your emotions are extreme, contact a real - life psychologist or a hotline first.</li><li>Protect your privacy: Try not to leave sensitive information such as your real identity, location, and family background.</li><li>Question authority: What AI says is never the '标准答案'. It has no life experience.</li><li>Observe dependence: If you find that you 'can't live without' AI chat companions, seek support and rebuild real - world relationships.</li></ol><h3>🧠 A gentle reminder:</h3><p>\"AI can accompany you through the emotional ocean at night, but it's the understanding and connection in the real world that will truly lead you out of the isolated island.\" Technology can be an auxiliary lighthouse for mental health, but it's not the shore.</p>"

        "keywords": ["male mental health", "stigma", "depression", "social change", "support system"],
        "description": "This article discusses the stigma of male mental health, including its definition, data on male depression treatment rates, reasons, consequences, and ways to change the situation.",
        "image": "images/11.png",
        "date": "2025-04-12",
        "content": "<p>👋 Hello! Today, let's talk about a crucial topic that many people overlook - the stigma of male mental health.</p><h3>🧠 What is the'stigma of male mental health'?</h3><p>The mental - health problems of men are often regarded by society as signs of 'weakness' or 'incompetence'. This leads to a large number of men being reluctant to express their emotions or seek professional help. This phenomenon is called the stigma of mental health. Especially in the case of male depression, such situations are often ignored or misdiagnosed. Because men are under the traditional expectations of'strong' and 'not crying' in society, it's more difficult for them to admit their vulnerability and emotional problems.</p><h3>📊 Data reveals: The treatment rate of male depression</h3><ul><li>According to research, the treatment rate of male depression is much lower than that of women, about 40%. In other words, more than 60% of men don't seek professional treatment or help when experiencing depression.</li><li>Compared with the treatment rate of female depression, men are reluctant to seek psychological counseling or treatment because they are afraid of being seen as 'weak' or 'failures'.</li><li>Even in some cultures, depression is considered a 'female patent'. Even if men show obvious depressive symptoms, they are often not taken seriously or supported by those around them.</li></ul><h3>💔 Why are men more likely to face the stigma of mental health?</h3><h4>1. Social gender - role expectations</h4><p>From childhood, men are often told to be'strong' and 'independent' and to avoid expressing emotions. Especially emotional vulnerability, such as sadness, depression, and anxiety, is often regarded as 'not manly' or 'unworthy of taking responsibility'.</p><h4>2. Cultural and social pressure</h4><p>In many cultures, men bear the responsibility of'supporting the family'. The social success standard for men is higher than that for women. Mental - health problems are seen as a sign of personal failure, which makes men dare not talk about or seek help.</p><h4>3. Differences in symptom presentation</h4><p>The symptoms of male depression are often less obvious. They may be more likely to show behaviors such as anger, irritability, and violent tendencies, rather than the 'typical' sadness or low - mood. This 'hidden' depression makes it difficult for people around to notice, which further intensifies their tendency not to seek help.</p><h3>🩺 Consequences of affecting male mental health</h3><ul><li>Self - isolation: When men encounter depression or anxiety, they are more likely to choose to bear it alone and are reluctant to share with others. This isolation may exacerbate the symptoms and lead to further emotional closure.</li><li>High - risk behaviors: Many studies show that untreated depression may lead men to take more extreme behaviors, such as alcoholism, drug abuse, and even suicide. The suicide rate of men is usually much higher than that of women, partly because they don't seek enough psychological help.</li><li>Physical - health problems: Mental - health problems are closely related to physical health. If men's psychological stress is not effectively released, it may trigger health problems such as high blood pressure and heart disease, forming a vicious circle.</li></ul><h3>🌍 How to change this phenomenon? [Advocacy and guidance suggestions]</h3><h4>1. Reduce stigma and encourage emotional expression</h4><p>Society needs to create a more inclusive environment to encourage men to express their emotions and vulnerability. We can convey the message that 'emotional expression is a sign of strength' through education, the media, and public activities. For example, movies and TV shows can also include more male characters who bravely face and express their emotions, showing how men deal with mental - health problems such as depression and anxiety.</p><h4>2. Raise public awareness and advocate mental - health education</h4><p>Through online and offline educational activities, raise the awareness of the male group about mental health. Events like 'World Mental Health Day' can be a good opportunity to hold mental - health lectures exclusive to men, popularizing the basic knowledge of mental health and emotion - regulation skills to them.</p><h4>3. Establish a support system: Comprehensive support from family to society</h4><p>○ Family level: The support of parents, spouses, and friends is particularly important. Encourage male family members to understand and respect that men also need emotional care. Family members should create a non - judgmental space where men can freely express their feelings and avoid regarding their emotional distress as a 'weakness'.</p><p>○ Social level: The government and society can provide more support projects for male mental health. For example, add mental - health services in companies, schools, and communities, providing psychological counseling and support groups specifically for the male group to help them break through the barriers of mental health.</p><h4>4. Promote male mental health in education and the workplace</h4><p>○ Schools can offer 'emotional education' courses to help boys develop emotional - management and communication skills from an early age, reducing their neglect of mental - health problems in adulthood.</p><p>○ In the workplace, more psychological - support opportunities should be created for men, such as setting up employee mental - health hotlines and psychological - counseling services, so that men are no longer ashamed to seek help when facing work pressure.</p><h4>5. Advocate male - health activities and sports</h4><p>Encourage men to relieve stress and release emotions through healthy ways such as sports and meditation. For example, organize more male sports clubs and offer courses such as yoga and meditation, so that they can regulate psychological stress while exercising. Sports can not only improve physical health but also promote mental health.</p><h4>6. Build a safe mental - health treatment platform</h4><p>We should promote the establishment of more mental - health treatment platforms and online - counseling services designed specifically for men, so that men can consult professional psychologists in an anonymous and low - pressure environment. Such platforms should focus on providing practical psychological - regulation skills to help men more effectively cope with stress, anxiety, and depression.</p><h3>🧘‍♂️ Conclusion: You're not alone</h3><p>The stigma of male mental - health problems not only harms individuals' mental health but also damages the overall well - being of society. If your male friends around you or you yourself feel anxious or depressed, remember to seek professional help. You're not a 'weakling'; you just need understanding and support.</p><p>💬 Be brave to express and be brave to seek help. Let's break the prejudice that'men should be strong' together and build a more understanding and supportive society.</p>"

        "image": "images/12.png",
        "date": "2025-04-12",
        "content": "<p>🚨 The Misleading Nature of Influencer Psychological Advice: Toxic Positivity Worsens Conditions</p><p>In today's era of information explosion, the internet has become an important platform for us to acquire knowledge and advice. Many influencer psychological experts share mental - health advice through social media, blogs, and videos. While some advice can have a positive impact, there is also a lot of so - called 'toxic positivity' therapy being spread, which brings wrong psychological concepts to many people and even exacerbates their original psychological problems. Today, let's talk about the misleading nature of these influencer psychological advice and their potential harm to mental health.</p><h3>🧠 What is 'toxic positivity' therapy?</h3><p>'Toxic positivity' is a term originating from internet culture, referring to psychological advice that seems positive and inspiring but is actually empty and unrealistic. These suggestions usually emphasize self - strength, ignore the complexity of mental - health problems, and simply attribute them to 'you'll get better as long as you work hard'. For example:</p><ul><li>'If you're unhappy, just adjust your mindset. The world is still wonderful.'</li><li>'If you don't work hard, you'll stay at the bottom forever.'</li><li>'Don't complain. If you can't do it, it just proves you're not strong enough.'</li></ul><p>These statements seem inspiring, but in fact, they ignore the deep - seated causes of psychological problems and individual differences. They simply and rudely require individuals to quickly adjust their emotions, leaving many people in difficult situations feeling more isolated and helpless.</p><h3>🚨 The harm of misleading advice:</h3><h4>1. Ignoring individual differences</h4><p>Everyone's psychological condition is unique. Psychological problems cannot be solved by a one - size - fits - all approach of'state - of - mind adjustment' or 'positive energy'. Mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety cannot be overcome simply by self - adjustment. Instead, they may require professional psychological treatment, medication intervention, and long - term psychological support. Simplifying the problem to 'working hard' or'self - adjustment' often traps those who really need help, making them feel that their problems are due to 'not working hard enough' and thus increasing self - blame.</p><h4>2. Aggravating guilt and self - blame</h4><p>Influencer psychological advice often uses extreme language, simply stating that 'if you can't do it, you're not strong enough'. This kind of statement makes people experiencing psychological problems feel more powerless and ashamed, thinking that they don't deserve to seek help or express vulnerability. Staying in this state of self - blame and shame for a long time may lead to more serious psychological problems, such as the aggravation of depression, the worsening of anxiety, and even self - harm behavior.</p><h4>3. Promoting excessive self - reliance</h4><p>Many influencer psychological advice promotes the idea of 'being self - strong', encouraging people to rely too much on themselves to solve problems when facing difficulties and ignoring the importance of seeking professional help. This extreme self - reliance makes individuals feel more isolated when encountering emotional problems they can't solve, unable to effectively seek necessary support, and even stay away from professional treatment, leading to the further deterioration of the problem.</p><h4>4. Misleading the public's understanding of psychological treatment</h4><p>Many influencer psychological advice confuses psychological treatment with simple'self - motivation', misleading people into thinking that psychological problems don't require professional treatment and can be solved only through'state - of - mind adjustment' and 'positive thinking'. This misunderstanding may cause those in need of treatment to miss timely intervention and even delay the illness, resulting in the long - term ineffective alleviation of the disease.</p><h3>⚠️ The gap between online advice and professional treatment:</h3><h4>1. The depth and methods of psychological treatment</h4><p>Professional psychological treatment often relies on a variety of treatment methods, such as cognitive - behavioral therapy, dialectical - behavior therapy, and medication, to provide personalized solutions for different psychological problems. However, online advice is mostly too general and superficial, lacking a detailed analysis of individual psychological symptoms, which easily leads to misguidance.</p><h4>2. Long - term and step - by - step process</h4><p>Solving mental - health problems is not an overnight thing. It usually requires long - term treatment and emotion management. Psychological treatment is a gradual process that requires in - depth communication with professional psychotherapists, rather than a quick fix through short 'inspirational quotes'. Online advice often overemphasizes 'immediate results', and this short - term thinking misleads people's understanding of psychological treatment, making them expect to recover quickly through simple methods.</p><h4>3. Emotional support and companionship</h4><p>In psychological treatment, patients need a supportive environment and emotional companionship, rather than simple'self - adjustment'. Professional psychological treatment can provide in - depth emotional support for individuals, helping them understand their emotions, find the root cause, and gradually recover. In contrast, online advice usually ignores the complexity of emotions, overemphasizes 'positive emotions', and neglects individuals' real feelings and needs.</p><h3>🚶‍♂️ How to avoid the influence of misleading advice?</h3><h4>1. Question and verify</h4><p>For mental - health advice on the internet, we should learn to be skeptical and verify it. Especially in terms of self - diagnosis and treatment, we must consult professional psychologists or psychotherapists to avoid blindly following or being misled by online advice.</p><h4>2. Seek professional help</h4><p>If you feel emotionally troubled or your mental problems affect your quality of life, seeking professional help in a timely manner is the wisest choice. Professional psychotherapists can customize effective treatment plans according to individual circumstances, rather than simply giving 'inspirational' advice.</p><h4>3. View online advice rationally</h4><p>The internet is full of various mental - health advice. Some advice is indeed useful, but many are unproven. If you come across advice that doesn't suit your actual situation, you can try to discuss it with professionals and rationally evaluate the value of each piece of information.</p><h3>🧘‍♀️ Conclusion:</h3><p>Mental health is a topic that everyone should pay attention to. We should abandon the empty advice of 'toxic positivity', listen to our inner voices, and respect our emotional and psychological needs.

Today, let's discuss a topic that has been gradually attracting attention: brain fog and depression caused by Long COVID.</p><h3>🧠 What is Long COVID?</h3><p>Long COVID refers to patients who experience persistent symptoms for weeks or even months after being infected with the COVID - 19 virus. These symptoms are not limited to the respiratory system and may also affect other parts of the body, including the cardiovascular, nervous, and digestive systems. For some people, even after their body temperature returns to normal and they no longer feel obvious physical discomfort, they may still encounter some persistent symptoms such as brain fog, fatigue, anxiety, and depression.</p><h3>💭 Manifestations and impacts of brain fog</h3><p>Brain fog is one of the symptoms often described by Long COVID patients. It usually manifests as:</p><ul><li>Difficulty concentrating and being easily distracted.</li><li>Memory loss, such as often forgetting what one is doing or frequently misplacing things.</li><li>Slow thinking, and sometimes even difficulty in speaking and thinking.</li><li>Inability to sort out thoughts and often feeling a 'blank mind'.</li></ul><p>The appearance of brain fog often reduces patients' work efficiency, seriously affects their quality of life, and may even impact their social and emotional health.</p><h3>😔 Depression and Long COVID</h3><p>In addition to brain fog, depression is also a common complication of Long COVID. According to research and patient reports, Long COVID may trigger or exacerbate depressive symptoms. The reasons are as follows:</p><h4>1. Physical weakness and persistent discomfort</h4><p>Long - term fatigue and physical discomfort make patients feel a loss of control over their lives. This sense of powerlessness may lead to the emergence of depressive emotions. Patients may feel that they cannot recover and even lose hope of recovery.</p><h4>2. Psychological burden</h4><p>People who have experienced COVID - 19 infection often face high levels of anxiety and psychological pressure, worrying that their health conditions will not improve in the long term. Coupled with society's expectations for 'COVID - 19 recovery', many people may feel a sense of shame or failure, which in turn leads to low mood and depression.</p><h4>3. Physiological factors</h4><p>The COVID - 19 virus not only affects the lungs but may also affect the brain. Research has found that COVID - 19 may cause an inflammatory response in the brain, damage neural connections, and change the balance of neurotransmitters, thereby affecting mood regulation. These physiological changes may lead to the emergence or exacerbation of depressive symptoms.</p><h4>4. Isolation and social distancing</h4><p>Due to the uncertainty of Long COVID symptoms, patients may need to isolate at home and stay away from social activities. This sense of social isolation may intensify feelings of loneliness and further trigger depressive symptoms.</p><h3>📊 Data: The impact of Long COVID</h3><p>According to reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) and multiple research institutions, approximately 10% to 30% of COVID - 19 patients will develop Long COVID. Although this situation is still under study, more and more evidence shows that the impact of Long COVID on the nervous system is significant. Here are some common impacts:</p><ul><li>Fatigue: Most Long COVID patients experience severe and persistent fatigue, which affects their daily lives and work abilities.</li><li>Memory and cognitive impairment: A large number of patients report feeling confused in thinking, having difficulty concentrating or completing work tasks.</li><li>Depression and anxiety: Emotional disorders occur frequently, and some patients show depressive and anxious symptoms parallel to long - term physical symptoms.</li></ul><h3>⚖️ Coping strategies</h3><p>Although there is no unified treatment plan for Long COVID at present, there are some methods that can help relieve brain fog and depressive symptoms:</p><h4>1. Psychological support and treatment</h4><p>For depressive symptoms caused by Long COVID, psychological treatment (such as cognitive - behavioral therapy and talk therapy) can help patients better cope with emotional distress. Psychological counseling can help patients rebuild their mental health and enhance their sense of self - control.</p><h4>2. Physical exercise</h4><p>Even gentle exercises such as walking or yoga can help reduce fatigue, improve mood, and promote the recovery of cognitive function. Research shows that exercise can promote the release of beneficial chemicals (such as endorphins) in the brain to fight depression.</p><h4>3. Diet and nutritional supplements</h4><p>A healthy diet can provide the necessary nutrients for the brain, which helps reduce fatigue and improve thinking ability. In addition, supplementing nutrients beneficial to the brain such as Omega - 3 fatty acids and vitamin D can also help restore cognitive function.</p><h4>4. Rest and sleep</h4><p>Adequate rest and sleep are crucial for relieving brain fog. Long COVID patients should pay special attention to adjusting their work and rest schedules, avoid over - exertion, and ensure that the brain can fully recover.</p><h4>5. Medication</h4><p>For patients who have been troubled by depression for a long time, doctors may recommend the use of antidepressant drugs. These drugs can help regulate neurotransmitters in the brain and relieve depressive emotions.</p><h3>🌱 Conclusion: Regaining hope in life</h3><p>The brain fog and depressive symptoms brought by Long COVID pose a huge challenge to patients' quality of life. However, through scientific intervention, psychological support, and lifestyle adjustments, many people can gradually recover. Most importantly, patients need to realize that they are not alone, and support is always available. Be patient, seek help, and you will gradually regain control and hope in life.</p><p>💬 If you or your relatives and friends are experiencing the troubles of Long COVID, don't hesitate to seek professional help and support. You are not alone, and there is light ahead.</p>"
