    <div id="article-description"><p>Today, let's talk about a controversial yet promising topic: Microdosing Psychedelics Treatment, especially the co - existence of breakthroughs and risks in the field of psychotherapy 🌈🧠</p><h3>🍄 What is Microdosing Psychedelics?</h3><p>"Microdosing" refers to taking extremely low doses of psychedelic substances, such as psilocybin (the active ingredient in magic mushrooms), LSD, MDMA, etc. The dosage is generally 1/10 to 1/20 of the standard dose. This dose does not cause obvious "hallucinogenic" experiences but is said to improve mood, creativity, focus, and even treat mental illnesses.</p><h3>🚀 Breakthroughs: Magic Mushroom Treatment for Depression and PTSD Enters Legalization Pilot</h3><h4>✅ Canada</h4><ul><li>Since 2020, Health Canada has allowed some terminally ill patients to use psilocybin under psychological counseling.</li><li>In clinical trials, over 70% of patients with treatment - resistant depression showed significant improvement in symptoms after using it.</li></ul><h4>✅ Australia</h4><ul><li>Since 2023, it has become the world's first country to approve psychedelic drugs as legal prescription drugs.</li><li>Psychiatrists can use psilocybin to treat depression and PTSD under strict supervision.</li><li>Meanwhile, MDMA has also been approved for the treatment of severe trauma.</li></ul><p>These breakthroughs are supported by an increasing number of neuroimaging studies: Psilocybin can "restart" the brain regions related to emotional regulation, helping patients break out of negative thinking loops and producing weeks - long mood improvement.</p><h3>🎯 Potential Efficacy of Microdosing (Under Research)</h3><ul><li>🧠 Improve mood and well - being</li><li>🎨 Stimulate creativity and inspiration</li><li>🧘 Relieve chronic mental illnesses such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD</li><li>🔁 Change the brain's "default mode network" (DMN), helping people break out of the cycle of excessive introspection and anxiety</li></ul><h3>⚠️ Risks and Controversies: "Black - Market Psychedelics" and Safety Hazards</h3><p>Despite the continuous progress of legalization, microdosing psychedelics still pose the following major risks:</p><h4>❌ Black - Market Abuse</h4><ul><li>Some people buy psilocybin or LSD through non - formal channels, with unknown dosages and complex ingredients.</li><li>There have been cases in North America where psychedelics contaminated with fentanyl led to death, causing an uproar in public opinion.</li><li>Some people develop hallucinatory anxiety, sensory confusion, or even show signs of schizophrenia after long - term microdosing.</li></ul><h4>❌ Higher Risks for People with Mental Illnesses</h4><ul><li>People with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder may experience severe episodes if they take these substances without permission.</li><li>Clinical studies emphasize that professional psychological support and environmental management are essential; otherwise, the consequences can be uncontrollable.</li></ul><h4>❌ Legal Gray Areas</h4><ul><li>Although some countries have started the legalization process, most regions still consider these substances "controlled drugs", and their possession and use are illegal.</li><li>The prevalence of commercial hype and online "spiritual healing camps" has also deviated public perception from the scientific track.</li></ul><h3>🧪 So, is microdosing psychedelics a healing miracle or a dangerous edge?</h3><p>It can be both a cure and a poison, depending on:</p><ul><li>📍 Whether it is used under the guidance of a professional psychologist.</li><li>⚖️ Whether there is legal and clear dosage and environmental control.</li><li>🧠 Whether there is a real assessment and follow - up of mental state.</li><li>📚 Whether it is based on scientific research rather than following online folk remedies blindly.</li></ul><h3>🧭 Summary and Reminder</h3><p>Microdosing psychedelics treatment is a great hope for future psychiatry, but it is not a panacea. It can only be a tool in a serious medical system and should not be blindly imitated without supervision and science. 🌱 If you or someone around you is experiencing anxiety, depression, or trauma, seeking formal psychological counseling and psychiatric help is the safest and most effective first step. Don't let the "spiritual craze" on social media overshadow the science and risks in reality.</p></div>
