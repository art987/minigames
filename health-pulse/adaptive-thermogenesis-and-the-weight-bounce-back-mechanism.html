    <div id="article-description"><h3>üîç Background introduction:</h3><p>Adaptive thermogenesis, also known as metabolic compensation, is the body's self - regulatory process to maintain energy balance when encountering extreme environmental changes such as dieting or high - intensity exercise. Usually, when our calorie intake decreases, the body's metabolic rate drops to reduce energy consumption and adapt to the lower calorie intake. This is why many people face a weight plateau after long - term dieting or weight loss, where their weight stops decreasing despite strict diet control and increased exercise. This bounce - back mechanism is not only related to weight loss but also involves a decrease in metabolic rate, making it easier for people to regain their previous weight or even exceed it.</p><h3>üîÑ Mechanisms of metabolic compensation</h3><h4>1. Dieting and metabolic slowdown</h4><p>When people engage in extreme dieting (e.g., very - low - calorie diet, VLCD), the body first reduces non - exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), such as reducing daily minor movements, standing, or walking, to cut down on energy consumption. At the same time, the basal metabolic rate (BMR) also drops, especially as muscle mass is lost, leading to a decrease in energy expenditure.</p><h4>2. Changes in hunger hormones</h4><p>After dieting, the body's hunger hormones (such as ghrelin) increase, while satiety hormones (such as glucagon - like peptide - 1) decrease, resulting in an increased sense of hunger. This further prompts people to consume more food and increase calorie intake.</p><h4>3. Metabolic adaptive response</h4><p>The core of the metabolic adaptive response is that when energy intake decreases, the body's metabolic rate (including the basal metabolic rate and post - exercise metabolic rate) drops. This means that the body slows down the fat - burning process, and more calories are retained to cope with the perceived survival threat. Over time, a weight plateau occurs, and it becomes difficult to continue losing weight.</p><h4>4. Formation of the weight plateau</h4><p>As the dieting period lengthens, the body's adaptive response becomes more pronounced, causing the metabolic rate to drop by 30% or more. At this point, even though the calorie intake is lower than normal, due to the decreased metabolic rate, the weight enters a plateau, and the weight - loss process significantly slows down or even stops.</p><h3>üìâ Bounce - back mechanism</h3><h4>1. Weight regain after resuming normal intake</h4><p>Once the diet ends or normal eating resumes, the body quickly uses the lower metabolic rate and the previously accumulated hunger to accelerate fat storage. This is one of the reasons why many people regain weight rapidly after ending a diet.</p><h4>2. Decrease in muscle mass</h4><p>Long - term dieting, especially a very - low - calorie diet, leads to a decrease in muscle mass. Since muscle is the main 'engine' for burning calories, the reduction in muscle mass not only lowers the basal metabolic rate but also makes it easier to store fat after resuming normal eating, further exacerbating weight bounce - back.</p><h4>3. Neuroendocrine response</h4><p>The hormonal changes caused by dieting are not limited to hunger hormones; the secretion of thyroid hormones is also affected. Thyroid hormones (especially T3) decrease during dieting, reducing the speed of the metabolic rate and making metabolic adaptation during the recovery period more difficult.</p><h3>üìä Influencing factors and individual differences</h3><p>Although metabolic compensation is a common phenomenon, its degree varies among individuals. The following factors may affect the intensity of metabolic compensation:</p><h4>1. Speed and amplitude of weight loss</h4><p>Rapid weight loss usually triggers a stronger metabolic adaptation, resulting in a significant drop in metabolic rate. In contrast, gradual weight loss (e.g., losing no more than 0.5 kg per week) may cause less excessive metabolic adaptation.</p><h4>2. Gender differences</h4><p>Some studies show that men and women have different metabolic adaptations during dieting. Women may experience a greater decrease in metabolic rate with lower calorie intake and may be more prone to weight bounce - back.</p><h4>3. Body composition</h4><p>People with more muscle mass generally have a higher metabolic rate, so they may face less metabolic adaptation during dieting. Those with less muscle mass may experience more metabolic slowdown.</p><h4>4. Genetic differences</h4><p>Individual genetic differences play an important role in metabolic adaptation. Some genes may make individuals more prone to the metabolic compensation effect during weight loss, while others may result in less metabolic decline.</p><h3>üß† Countermeasures and suggestions</h3><h4>1. Gradual weight loss</h4><p>Avoid extreme dieting and adopt a gradual weight - loss method. While reducing calorie intake, increase moderate exercise (especially resistance training) to build muscle mass and maintain a high metabolic rate.</p><h4>2. High - protein diet</h4><p>Increasing protein intake can help maintain muscle mass, reduce muscle loss due to dieting, and prevent a significant drop in metabolic rate.</p><h4>3. Avoid long - term very - low - calorie diet</h4><p>A long - term very - low - calorie diet not only leads to muscle loss but may also cause various health problems. Timely diet cycle adjustments (such as intermittent fasting) may help maintain a healthy metabolism.</p><h4>4. Pay attention to nutrition during the recovery phase</h4><p>After dieting, gradually resume normal eating and avoid suddenly increasing a large amount of calorie intake. This can prevent rapid weight bounce - back due to metabolic adaptation.</p><h3>üå± Summary:</h3><p>Metabolic compensation is a self - protective mechanism of the body in the face of extreme dieting, usually resulting in a decrease in metabolic rate and the formation of a weight plateau. This phenomenon is related not only to the speed of weight loss and the intensity of dieting but also to hormonal changes, muscle loss, and other factors. To effectively avoid metabolic compensation and weight bounce - back, a gradual weight - loss method should be adopted, and good exercise habits, especially resistance training, should be maintained to preserve muscle mass and promote a healthy metabolism.</p></div>
