Why Should Women's Nutrition Be &ldquo;Customized&rdquo;?</h3><p>A woman's life goes through multiple stages such as adolescence, reproductive age, pregnancy, and menopause, and the nutritional needs of the body vary at each stage. For example:</p><ul><li>💃 During menstruation: Iron and vitamin B complex need to be supplemented.</li><li>🤰 During pregnancy planning/pregnancy: Folic acid, calcium, and DHA are essential.</li><li>👩‍🦳 After menopause: Pay attention to bone density, and the combination of calcium and vitamin D is a must.</li></ul><p>Therefore, women's nutrition is not as simple as &ldquo;eating more vegetables&rdquo;, but rather &ldquo;eating at the right time, according to needs, and in the right amount&rdquo; to eat health and beauty 💖.</p><h3>🥗 II. Top 5 Key Nutrients for Women</h3><h4>1️⃣ Iron</h4><p>🚺 Women are more prone to anemia due to physiological reasons. Iron deficiency can lead to problems such as fatigue and dizziness.
