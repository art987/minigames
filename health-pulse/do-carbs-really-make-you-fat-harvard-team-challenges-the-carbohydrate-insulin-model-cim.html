    <div id="article-description"><h3>📣 Introduction</h3><p>Since the low - carb diet and ketogenic diet craze swept the globe, the theory that "carbs = the main culprit of obesity" has taken root in people's minds. However, a "scientific storm" from Harvard is now challenging this view - are carbs really that "guilty"?</p><h3>📍 What is the CIM Model? A Quick Review</h3><p>The Carbohydrate - Insulin Model (CIM) holds that consuming too many high - glycemic - index carbohydrates (such as white rice and desserts) leads to an increase in blood sugar, which in turn causes an increase in insulin secretion. This inhibits fat breakdown and promotes fat storage, ultimately making people gain weight. In simple terms, "it's not that you eat too much, but that you eat too many carbs!"</p><h3>🧪 Harvard's Challenge</h3><p>Kevin Hall, a nutritionist from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and his team pointed out:</p><h4>1. The Key to Weight Gain is Calorie Surplus</h4><p>In experiments comparing high - carb and low - carb diets, as long as the total calorie intake is the same, the difference in body fat change is not significant.</p><h4>2. Insulin Secretion is Not the Only Driver of Weight Gain</h4><p>○ Many thin people also have a high insulin response.</p><p>○ Some obese patients have normal insulin sensitivity.</p><h4>3. Short - Term Low - Carb Diet Leads to Weight Loss, but Long - Term Results Tend to Be the Same</h4><p>○ After 12 months, the weight loss of the low - carb and high - carb groups is similar.</p><p>○ The difference mainly lies in the changes in "water + glycogen reserves" in the first three months.</p><p>Their paper published in <em>The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em> states that the CIM cannot explain all the mechanisms of obesity.</p><h3>🍰 Why Do We Gain Weight?</h3><p>The Harvard team emphasizes:</p><ul><li>When calorie intake exceeds calorie consumption, weight gain occurs.</li><li>The type of food affects "how much you eat" far more than "whether the food itself makes you fat".</li><li>Processed foods and foods high in sugar and fat are addictive and easy to overeat.</li></ul><p>The body's regulatory system is affected not only by insulin but also by multiple factors such as leptin, ghrelin, and the brain's reward system.</p><h3>⚖️ CIM vs. Calorie Balance Model: A Visual Comparison</h3><table><tr><th>Model</th><th>Core Proposition</th><th>Reason for Popularity</th></tr><tr><td>🧬 CIM Model</td><td>"Carbs increase insulin, which promotes fat accumulation."</td><td>It has promoted the ketogenic and low - carb diet trends.</td></tr><tr><td>🔥 Calorie Balance Model</td><td>"Eating more and moving less is the root cause, and the type of food is secondary."</td><td>It supports flexible and diverse eating patterns.</td></tr></table><h3>🌟 CIM is Not Wrong, but Can't Be Applied One - Size - Fits - All</h3><h4>🙋‍♀️ Who Might Benefit from CIM?</h4><ul><li>Patients with severe insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.</li><li>People who need to quickly break through the weight - loss plateau in the initial stage of fat loss.</li><li>People who need to control blood sugar (such as those in the pre - diabetes stage and with PCOS).</li></ul><h4>⚠️ For Most People</h4><p>Completely eliminating carbs is not only difficult to maintain but may also cause:</p><ul><li>Emotional fluctuations.</li><li>Suppression of thyroid function.</li><li>Female hormone disorders (such as irregular menstruation).</li></ul><h3>🔥 Popular Search Terms</h3><ul><li>"Carbs are not the enemy."</li><li>"Low - carb diets lead to quick weight loss but severe rebound?"</li><li>"Calorie deficit is the truth of weight loss."</li><li>"The method of re - introducing carbs into the diet."</li></ul><h3>🎯 Summary</h3><p>The CIM provides a possible explanation for fat accumulation, but the principle of "calorie surplus" cannot be ignored. Weight loss is never about "finding a scapegoat" but about finding a balance that you can stick to.</p></div>
