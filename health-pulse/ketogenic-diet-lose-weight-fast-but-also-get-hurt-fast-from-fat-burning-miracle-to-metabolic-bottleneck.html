    <div id="article-description"><h3>🥑 Introduction</h3><p>Hello everyone! Today, let's dissect a popular weight - loss approach - the Ketogenic Diet. It was once hailed as the 'holy grail of fat - burning', but recently, the scientific community has started to be wary of its metabolic adaptation bottlenecks, especially its impact on thyroid function. So, is it a nutritional revolution or a health over - draw? Let's find out! 🔬</p><h3>🥩 What is the Ketogenic Diet?</h3><p>The ketogenic diet is centered around 'high - fat + low - carb + moderate - protein', making the body abandon carbohydrates as the main energy source and instead 'burn fat to produce ketone bodies' for energy. 📌 The general nutritional distribution is:</p><ul><li>Fat: 70 - 80%</li><li>Protein: 15 - 20%</li><li>Carbohydrates: Only about 5% (less than 50g per day). The goal is to enter a state of ketosis → for rapid fat loss, blood - sugar control, and improved brain energy metabolism.</li></ul><h3>📉 The Problem: Does the Body Rebel After 'Ketone Adaptation'?</h3><p>Over time, more and more people trying the diet have raised questions on social platforms:</p><ul><li>'I lost weight quickly in the first two months, but now it's stuck...'</li><li>'I've been feeling really cold, tired, and losing hair recently...'</li><li>'My period suddenly stopped. Did I cut out carbs too much?' These are not illusions but signals of metabolic adaptation and endocrine suppression. ⚠️</li></ul><h3>🧬 Latest Research: Low - Carb Diet Suppresses Thyroid Function</h3><p>📊 A study published in the <em>Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism</em> in 2023 found that a long - term high - fat and extremely low - carb diet can lead to a significant decrease in T3 (triiodothyronine) levels. T3 is an important hormone that controls metabolism, body - temperature regulation, and heart rate. 🔄 The reasons are as follows:</p><ul><li>🔥 T3 is closely related to carbohydrate intake. A lack of carbohydrates reduces the efficiency of the liver's conversion of T4 to T3.</li><li>💡 The ketogenic diet makes the body enter an 'energy - saving mode' - to survive, it automatically slows down metabolism and starts to 'conserve energy'.</li><li>❄️ The consequences include: ○ Feeling cold easily and being afraid of the cold. ○ Feeling depressed and having low energy. ○ Irregular menstruation. ○ A slowdown or even rebound in fat loss.</li></ul><h3>🚧 Common Signs of the 'Ketogenic Adaptation Bottleneck'</h3><table><tr><th>Symptoms</th><th>Underlying Mechanisms</th></tr><tr><td>🥶 Cold hands and feet</td><td>Decrease in thyroid T3 and slower metabolism</td></tr><tr><td>💤 Persistent fatigue</td><td>Depletion of liver glycogen and insufficient ketone - body supply</td></tr><tr><td>💇‍♀️ Hair loss and dry skin</td><td>Uneven nutrition and hormonal fluctuations</td></tr><tr><td>🚫 Stalled fat loss</td><td>The body enters a 'defensive homeostasis'</td></tr><tr><td>❌ Absence of menstruation</td><td>Disruption of the hypothalamic - pituitary - gonadal axis</td></tr></table><h3>🎯 Should You Abandon the Ketogenic Diet?</h3><p>Not necessarily. The ketogenic diet is not suitable for everyone or every stage. It should be adjusted according to individuals and cycles:</p><ul><li>✅ Suitable for: ● People with severe insulin resistance (such as type 2 diabetes, PCOS). ● Treatment of epilepsy or certain neurological diseases. ● People who want to lose weight quickly in the short term.</li><li>⚠️ Not suitable for: ● People with hypothyroidism. ● Pregnant and breastfeeding women. ● Women with irregular periods and emotional sensitivity. ● People who have been on long - term diets and have a tendency to binge - eat.</li></ul><h3>🛠️ Coping Strategies: Don't Let 'Ketogenic' Become 'Harmful Ketogenic'</h3><p>📌 Moderate 'carb cycling': ● Set aside 1 - 2 days a week to appropriately increase healthy carbohydrates (such as brown rice, sweet potatoes, quinoa) to restore T3 levels. 📌 Monitor basal body temperature and T3 indicators: ● If the body temperature remains low and fatigue is obvious, thyroid function should be checked. 📌 Maintain a balanced diet: ● Sufficient protein. ● Supplement B - vitamins, iron, and selenium (important for the thyroid). ● Ensure a daily intake of no less than 1200 kcal.</p><h3>🧠 Summary</h3><p>It's not that you can't lose weight anymore; it's that your body is protecting itself. The ketogenic diet is like a double - edged sword. The initial results are amazing, but without scientific intervention in the long - term, it may trigger alarms in the metabolic system. Instead of pursuing an 'extremely low - carb' diet, it's better to find the 'right balance' for yourself. 💡</p></div>
