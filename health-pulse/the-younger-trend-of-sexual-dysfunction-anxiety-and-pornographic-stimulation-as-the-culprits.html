    <div id="article-description"><h3>Introduction</h3><p>In recent years, the younger trend of sexual dysfunction has become more and more obvious. Data shows that the incidence of erectile dysfunction (ED) among men under 30 has reached 15%, which is quite shocking. More and more young people, especially in the stressful modern life, are suffering from sexual health problems, and the reasons behind it have also attracted wide attention.</p><h3>üß† Main Causes of Sexual Dysfunction: Anxiety and Excessive Pornographic Stimulation</h3><h4>1Ô∏è‚É£ The Influence of Psychological Stress and Anxiety</h4><p>With the intensification of social competition, young people are facing great pressure from work, study, and life. Anxiety and depression have become high - risk factors for sexual dysfunction. Research shows that men who are in a state of anxiety for a long time may have a disorder of the nervous system due to excessive tension and uneasiness, which in turn affects sexual desire and erectile function.</p><h4>2Ô∏è‚É£ Excessive Stimulation of Pornographic Content</h4><p>The popularization of smartphones and the Internet makes it easy for young people to access a large amount of pornographic content. Over - reliance on visual stimulation, especially long - term viewing of high - intensity pornographic videos, can affect the brain's response to normal sexual stimuli, leading to sexual dysfunction. This is because excessive stimulation can disrupt the normal sexual physiological response and reduce the sexual attraction to real partners.</p><h3>ü©∫ The Rise of Non - drug Therapies: Pelvic Floor Muscle Training</h3><p>Facing this problem, although drug treatment is effective in some cases, with concerns about side effects and drug dependence, more and more young people are seeking non - drug therapies. Among them, pelvic floor muscle training has become a solution that has attracted much attention.</p><h4>1Ô∏è‚É£ The Principle of Pelvic Floor Muscle Training</h4><p>The pelvic floor muscles are located at the bottom of the pelvis and are responsible for supporting the genitals, bladder, and intestines. By consciously contracting and relaxing the pelvic floor muscles, the strength and flexibility of the muscles can be enhanced, and blood circulation can be improved, thus helping men restore sexual function. Research shows that regular pelvic floor muscle training can significantly improve erectile function and help relieve sexual problems caused by anxiety.</p><h4>2Ô∏è‚É£ The Advantages of Pelvic Floor Muscle Training</h4><ul><li>üå± No need for drug dependence</li><li>üïí Flexible training time</li><li>üí™ Can be done at home</li><li>üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Helps relieve anxiety and stress</li></ul><h3>üîç Expert Advice: Maintaining Mental and Physical Health is the Key</h3><p>Sexual dysfunction is not only a physiological problem but also a manifestation of psychology and emotion. Therefore, experts emphasize that in addition to pelvic floor muscle training, young people should also pay attention to overall mental health management.</p><ol><li>Regular exercise: Exercise can not only relieve stress but also improve the overall blood circulation of the body, helping men restore sexual ability.</li><li>Psychological counseling: If anxiety or depression is severe, seeking professional psychological counseling or treatment is necessary to help adjust bad emotions and improve self - confidence.</li><li>Reasonable use of technology: Avoid excessive indulgence in pornographic content, control unhealthy sexual stimulation sources, and cultivate healthy and positive sexual concepts.</li></ol><h3>üó£Ô∏è Conclusion</h3><p>The younger trend of sexual dysfunction reminds us that even young people should not ignore their sexual health problems. Social pressure, emotional distress, and bad habits may affect health unconsciously. Therefore, taking active measures such as psychological adjustment and non - drug therapies (such as pelvic floor muscle training) has become a trend for more and more young men to seek healthy solutions. ‚ú® Only by paying attention to physical health and reducing mental burden can we truly achieve physical and mental pleasure, and regain sexual function and confidence!</p></div>
