    <div id="article-description"><h3>🔍 Background Introduction</h3><p>Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) refers to the most basic energy consumed by the body at rest to support vital activities such as breathing, circulation, and body temperature maintenance. We usually think that through exercise, especially resistance training (such as weightlifting) and aerobic exercise (such as running, swimming, etc.), we can significantly increase BMR, thereby increasing calorie consumption and helping with fat loss. However, is this really the case?</p><h3>🏋️‍♀️ Relationship between Resistance Training and BMR</h3><h4>1. Muscle - Building Effect</h4><p>Resistance training is generally considered to be able to increase muscle mass. Since muscle is thought to consume more energy than fat, it is often considered to be able to significantly increase BMR. Theoretically, for every 1 kilogram of muscle gained, the basal metabolic rate will increase by a certain amount of calories.</p><h4>2. Research Conclusion</h4><p>Multiple studies have shown that gaining 1 kilogram of muscle will increase BMR by about 13 calories. In contrast, many people may expect more metabolic benefits, but the actual increase is limited. The increase in BMR brought about by muscle - building is not as significant as we think.</p><h4>3. Actual Impact</h4><p>Although the metabolic function of muscle is higher than that of fat, the proportion of muscle mass in the total body weight is small, so its effect on increasing BMR is limited. That is to say, although long - term resistance training can increase muscle mass, the increase in BMR is usually less than expected.</p><h3>🏃‍♂️ Relationship between Aerobic Exercise and BMR</h3><h4>1. Improving Cardiopulmonary Function and Fat Burning</h4><p>Aerobic exercise, especially medium - to high - intensity exercise for a relatively long time (such as running, swimming, etc.), usually significantly increases calorie consumption and cardiopulmonary function during exercise and promotes fat burning. Since these exercises improve the body's endurance and health level, they may indirectly improve the metabolic level.</p><h4>2. Research Conclusion</h4><p>Aerobic exercise can usually increase the metabolic rate through the short - term Excess Post - exercise Oxygen Consumption (EPOC), and this effect will last for several hours, sometimes even longer. However, in terms of long - term basal metabolic rate (BMR) increase, the impact of aerobic exercise is not as long - lasting as that of resistance training, and it is usually more difficult to maintain.</p><h3>🔄 Comprehensive Impact of Resistance Training vs. Aerobic Exercise on BMR</h3><h4>1. Main Effect of Resistance Training</h4><p>The main effect of resistance training is to increase the metabolic rate by increasing muscle mass. Although the increase in BMR brought about by muscle - building is relatively limited, the long - term increase in muscle mass can increase the basal metabolism to a certain extent, especially at rest.</p><h4>2. Main Effect of Aerobic Exercise</h4><p>Aerobic exercise mainly affects metabolism by improving cardiopulmonary function and reducing fat mass. Although fat consumption is more significant, the direct increase in basal metabolic rate is relatively small. Long - term high - intensity aerobic exercise may help reduce the body fat ratio and indirectly increase BMR.</p><h4>3. Comprehensive Increase in BMR</h4><p>○ If you simply pursue the long - term increase in BMR, resistance training has more advantages because it increases muscle mass, which will continuously consume energy at rest.</p><p>○ If the goal is to improve exercise performance and burn more calories, aerobic exercise is undoubtedly a more effective choice, especially during and after the exercise recovery period.</p><h3>🧠 Scientific Conclusion</h3><p>● The increase in BMR due to muscle gain is limited. Although the metabolic function of muscle is greater than that of fat, for every 1 kilogram of muscle gained, the basal metabolic rate only increases by about 13 calories, which is relatively low. The effect of muscle - building may be overestimated, especially in the short term, and the metabolic benefits brought by muscle are not significant.</p><p>● Long - term effect: Long - term resistance training can help maintain and increase muscle mass, thereby stably increasing BMR in the long run. While aerobic exercise does not significantly increase BMR, it can significantly improve cardiopulmonary health, increase exercise capacity, and help control the body fat ratio.</p><h3>🌱 Summary: Resistance Training vs. Aerobic Exercise</h3><p>● Resistance training has a positive effect on increasing muscle mass and maintaining basal metabolic rate, but the effect of each kilogram of muscle on increasing BMR is not as large as expected.</p><p>● Aerobic exercise is more significant for calorie consumption and fat burning, but its ability to increase BMR in the long term is weaker.</p><p>Therefore, to optimize the metabolic rate, it is best to combine resistance training and aerobic exercise, which can both increase muscle mass and improve cardiopulmonary function, thus obtaining more comprehensive health benefits.</p></div>
