    <div id="article-description"><p>&ldquo;We still love each other, but we haven't had sex for a long time.&rdquo; This is not an isolated case but a marital phenomenon spreading globally.</p><h3>📊 Striking data: Is a sexless marriage becoming the norm?</h3><p>According to a report from <i>The New York Times</i> and the Kinsey Institute, about 30% of couples in European and American countries have sex less than 10 times a year, which means less than once a month on average. Experts define this state as a &ldquo;sexless marriage&rdquo;, that is, no sexual intercourse for more than six consecutive months, or the frequency is extremely low and no longer valued by both parties. On Chinese social media, the topic of &ldquo;sexless marriage&rdquo; also remains popular. For example, &ldquo;Is it normal not to have intimate contact for two years after marriage?&rdquo;, &ldquo;I don't resist it, but I have no desire...&rdquo;, &ldquo;Where has the passion gone?&rdquo;</p><h3>🧠 Why are more and more marriages losing their sexual desire?</h3><p>The fast - paced and high - pressure modern married life has led to the &ldquo;passive withdrawal&rdquo; of sexual needs and emotional connections:</p><ul><li>🧱 High stress, reduced desire: Busy work, taking care of children, financial anxiety... The brain is in a &ldquo;fight or flight&rdquo; mode for a long time, and sexual desire naturally declines.</li><li>🪟 Emotional alienation, loss of intimacy: Lack of communication and long - term neglect of each other's emotions. Sex is often the &ldquo;barometer&rdquo; of an intimate relationship.</li><li>📺 Digital life interference: Is swiping short videos on the phone before bed more appealing than hugging? &ldquo;We are becoming more like roommates&rdquo; has become a common post - marriage scenario.</li><li>🧊 Hormonal changes: As people age, the decline in sex hormone levels is also a physiological factor, especially after menopause in women or a decrease in testosterone in men.</li></ul><h3>💬 How does society view sexless marriages?</h3><p>This phenomenon has sparked a lot of controversy:</p><ul><li>✔️ Some people say: Sex is not everything, and we are still intimate. They believe that &ldquo;we have just entered a more mature relationship stage, and mutual respect and companionship are more important than sex.&rdquo; Many couples maintain the &ldquo;warmth&rdquo; of their relationship through activities such as traveling, cooking, and parenting.</li><li>❌ Others say: No sex life = a precursor to the death of marriage. Some people equate the lack of sex with emotional coldness or emotional avoidance, and even regard it as a prelude to infidelity.</li></ul><h3>🔥 How to rekindle the passion? Revealing the popular keywords!</h3><p>On social platforms, &ldquo;how to rekindle the passion&rdquo; has become a trending keyword. Here are some proven effective directions:</p><ul><li>🛋️ Marriage counseling: Psychological research shows that professional marriage therapy has a significant effect on improving sexual life and communication quality. About 65% of couples said that their &ldquo;sexual life has improved significantly&rdquo; after counseling.</li><li>📝 Re - learning sex education: Many couples' understanding of each other's bodies and preferences still remains at a basic level. &ldquo;Re - understanding each other's body language&rdquo; is becoming part of the erotic courses for more and more people.</li><li>🧘 Mind - body synchronization exercises (such as gentle yoga and meditation): These can relieve stress and improve body sensitivity. Many couples try to rebuild physical connections through &ldquo;non - sexual contact&rdquo; ways.</li><li>🕯️ A sense of ritual in life: A candlelit dinner, a short trip, or watching a favorite TV show together. Sometimes, a serious dinner can bring more &ldquo;intimacy&rdquo; than a routine sexual encounter.</li></ul><h3>🤔 So, does a sexless marriage equal a failed marriage?</h3><p>Not necessarily. Psychologists believe that the core of a marriage is not just about sex, but whether there is still emotional dependence, effective communication, emotional support, and a space for self - identity. &ldquo;Being sexless&rdquo; can be a choice, not an escape. The key lies in whether you are both willing to understand this change and create new ways of connection for each other.</p><p>We are in an era of &ldquo;emotional and sexual diversity&rdquo;, and the definition of marriage is being rewritten. A sexless marriage may no longer be &ldquo;abnormal&rdquo; but a new face of an intimate relationship under modern pressure. But it is worth asking each other: &ldquo;Is there still desire and intimacy between us?&rdquo; &ldquo;Are we willing to get closer again?&rdquo;</p></div>
