    <div id="article-description"><p>&mdash;&mdash; Working from home: After three years of change, what are the gains and what are the losses?</p><h3>üè° The Popularity of Working from Home: A Global Overview</h3><p>Since the outbreak of the COVID - 19 pandemic in 2020, working from home has gradually become the norm for global enterprises. According to the latest data from Gartner, by 2025, more than <strong>40%</strong> of employees worldwide are expected to continue working remotely.</p><p>We can't help but wonder: What benefits has this work mode brought, and what unexpected challenges are there?</p><h3>üíº Global Comparison of Efficiency in Working from Home</h3><p>The efficiency of working from home is closely related to the work culture of each country. Here are the data on the efficiency of working from home in several countries:</p><p><table><thead><tr><th>Country/Region</th><th>Average Efficiency Increase in Working from Home (%)</th><th>Factors Affecting the Office Environment</th><th>Main Advantages</th><th>Main Challenges</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>USA</td><td>15%</td><td>Free and flexible office environment</td><td>High - efficiency work, reduced commuting time</td><td>Lack of team collaboration, social isolation</td></tr><tr><td>Germany</td><td>10%</td><td>Strict time management and discipline</td><td>Better work - life balance</td><td>Isolation, information asymmetry</td></tr><tr><td>Japan</td><td>5%</td><td>Efficient tool support</td><td>Gradual acceptance of the work - from - home culture</td><td>Extended working hours, anxiety</td></tr><tr><td>China</td><td>20%</td><td>Highly dependent on digital tools</td><td>Lower work pressure, high flexibility</td><td>Limited team interaction, overwork</td></tr><tr><td>UK</td><td>12%</td><td>Highly digital support</td><td>Efficient meeting arrangements, saved commuting</td><td>Blurred boundaries between work and private life</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>The United States: One of the countries with the greatest advantages in working from home. The saved commuting time has significantly improved employees' work efficiency.</p><p>Germany: Efficient time management has increased the efficiency of working from home, but the lack of social interaction is a non - negligible challenge.</p><h3>üå± Does Working from Home Increase or Decrease Happiness?</h3><p>Although the efficiency of working from home has increased, its impact on happiness varies from person to person. Here are the happiness scores of global employees working from home:</p><p><table><thead><tr><th>Country/Region</th><th>Happiness Increase (%)</th><th>Happiness Decrease (%)</th><th>Work - life Balance Score</th><th>Main Reasons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Sweden</td><td>45%</td><td>15%</td><td>8.4/10</td><td>Efficient separation of work and life</td></tr><tr><td>Canada</td><td>40%</td><td>20%</td><td>8.1/10</td><td>More family time, reduced social activities</td></tr><tr><td>USA</td><td>30%</td><td>35%</td><td>7.5/10</td><td>More personal space, but increased loneliness</td></tr><tr><td>Japan</td><td>25%</td><td>40%</td><td>6.8/10</td><td>Difficulty in adapting to the work - from - home culture</td></tr><tr><td>France</td><td>35%</td><td>25%</td><td>7.9/10</td><td>High flexibility, more personal time</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>Sweden and Canada: High work - life balance scores indicate that they have achieved relatively high happiness while working from home.</p><p>The United States and Japan: In some parts of the United States, extended working hours and lack of social activities have led to a decrease in happiness; in Japan, the work culture adapts slowly.</p><h3>üòì Rising Burnout: The "Side Effect" of Working from Home</h3><p>After working from home for a long time, especially without proper rest and a change in the work environment, many employees have begun to experience burnout. Here are the burnout data of employees working from home in 2025:</p><p><table><thead><tr><th>Country/Region</th><th>Proportion of Burnout Increase (%)</th><th>Working Hours (hours/week)</th><th>Main Reasons</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Japan</td><td>58%</td><td>50 hours</td><td>Long - term work, no clear "off - work" boundary</td></tr><tr><td>USA</td><td>45%</td><td>48 hours</td><td>Difficulty in distinguishing between work and family time</td></tr><tr><td>UK</td><td>30%</td><td>44 hours</td><td>Increased work pressure, lack of social interaction</td></tr><tr><td>Canada</td><td>25%</td><td>42 hours</td><td>Difficulty in "shutting down" while working from home</td></tr><tr><td>Australia</td><td>20%</td><td>40 hours</td><td>Flexible work - time management, but increased pressure</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p>Japan: The country with the most severe burnout. Long working hours and no clear "off - work" boundary are the main reasons.</p><p>The United States: High - intensity remote work and the difficulty in getting rid of work tasks have made employees experience a relatively high level of burnout.</p><h3>üöÄ Future Outlook: The Future Trends of Working from Home in 2025</h3><p>With the continuous advancement of technology and the gradual adaptation of corporate culture, working from home will continue to expand globally, but it also faces many challenges. Here are some predictions:</p><h4>1Ô∏è‚É£ More Intelligent Remote Work Tools</h4><p>AI and automation will make working from home more efficient. It is expected that by 2025, <strong>70%</strong> of employees will use intelligent meeting assistants, and <strong>50%</strong> of work tasks will be completed by automation.</p><h4>2Ô∏è‚É£ The Hybrid Work Model Becomes the Norm</h4><p>The hybrid work model (part - time at home and part - time in the company) will be popularized globally. It is expected that <strong>40%</strong> of companies will adopt this flexible work method to improve employee satisfaction.</p><h4>3Ô∏è‚É£ The Era of "Digital Nomads" Arrives</h4><p>Globally, more and more employees will become more free. It is expected that by 2025, <strong>30%</strong> of remote workers will choose to work across countries and become "digital nomads".</p><h3>üéØ Conclusion: Working from Home: A Trend or a Challenge?</h3><p>The advantages and challenges of working from home co - exist. It has not only reshaped the work environment but also changed the face of the global labor market. For enterprises, finding a balance between flexibility and efficiency will be a major test in the future. For employees, maintaining the boundary between work and life and avoiding burnout will be the key to the long - term effectiveness of working from home.</p></div>
