    <div id="article-description"><p>&mdash;&mdash; "Competition" doesn't equal happiness? The code for workplace happiness is being rewritten.</p><h3>üåç Who Is "Happily Working"? The Global Satisfaction Ranking Is Revealed</h3><p>In 2025, the feelings of workplace people towards work are becoming increasingly polarized. Based on a survey involving 480,000 people from 32 countries around the world, we've compiled the following satisfaction rankings:</p><h4>Global Top & Bottom 5 in Work Satisfaction</h4><p><table><thead><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Country/Region</th><th>Average Satisfaction (out of 5)</th><th>Proportion of High - Satisfaction (Score ‚â• 4)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Norway</td><td>‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è 4.7</td><td>83%</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Switzerland</td><td>4.6</td><td>79%</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>New Zealand</td><td>4.5</td><td>76%</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Canada</td><td>4.4</td><td>73%</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Netherlands</td><td>4.3</td><td>71%</td></tr><tr><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td><td>...</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>India</td><td>3.1</td><td>34%</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>Brazil</td><td>2.9</td><td>29%</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>China</td><td>2.8</td><td>27%</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>South Korea</td><td>2.6</td><td>23%</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>Japan</td><td>2.3</td><td>18%</td></tr></tbody></table></p><p><strong>Highlight:</strong> Nordic countries remain the "paradise for workers", while East Asian countries are "under great pressure".</p><h3>üß† What Affects the "Work - Happiness Index"?</h3><p>Analysis of the weight of the top 5 influencing factors:</p><p><table><thead><tr><th>Factor</th><th>Weight in Satisfaction</th><th>Remarks</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Work - life balance</td><td>32%</td><td>Flexible working hours and annual leave systems are crucial.</td></tr><tr><td>Compensation and benefits</td><td>27%</td><td>Not just salary, housing subsidies, insurance, equity, etc., are also important.</td></tr><tr><td>Relationship with supervisor/colleagues</td><td>17%</td><td>A good team is the "life - saving water" for workers.</td></tr><tr><td>Growth and promotion opportunities</td><td>13%</td><td>Positions without career paths are called "dead - ends in the workplace".</td></tr><tr><td>Corporate culture and values</td><td>11%</td><td>Young people especially value "doing meaningful things".</td></tr></tbody></table></p><h3>üè¢ Comparison Chart of Satisfaction in Different Industries</h3><p><table><thead><tr><th>Industry</th><th>Average Satisfaction</th><th>Typical Feedback</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Education and Research</td><td>4.2</td><td>"Not wealthy, but spiritually fulfilled."</td></tr><tr><td>IT and Internet</td><td>3.7</td><td>"Flexible and high - paying VS overtime anxiety."</td></tr><tr><td>Medical and Health</td><td>3.5</td><td>"High pressure, but high social recognition."</td></tr><tr><td>Finance and Insurance</td><td>3.2</td><td>"High salary, high competition."</td></tr><tr><td>Manufacturing and Logistics</td><td>2.8</td><td>"Physical labor + regular overtime."</td></tr><tr><td>Retail and Catering</td><td>2.6</td><td>"Unstable, low pay, and heavy emotional labor."</td></tr></tbody></table></p><h3>üîç Hot - Word Cloud of Chinese Workers' Voices</h3><p>"Anxiety", "Struggle", "Afraid to take leave", "Change careers", "Side jobs", "Just having a job is okay", "Remote work dream shattered", "Boss is too competitive", "Lying flat", "Persona collapse".</p><h3>üß≠ Comparison of Satisfaction between Young and Middle - Aged/Old Workers (in China)</h3><p><table><thead><tr><th>Age Group</th><th>Average Satisfaction</th><th>Typical Feedback</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>18 - 29 years old</td><td>2.6</td><td>"Dreams turn into reality, but reality is not sweet."</td></tr><tr><td>30 - 45 years old</td><td>2.9</td><td>"Heavy responsibilities, little freedom."</td></tr><tr><td>46 - 60 years old</td><td>3.3</td><td>"Stability is the most important, don't ask for too much."</td></tr></tbody></table></p><h3>‚ú® Conclusion: Where Is the "Happy Working Planet"?</h3><p>Work is not just a means of making a living but also a part of life. In the future, "workplace happiness" will no longer be determined by salary but by "whether you are respected", "whether you can be self - consistent", and "whether you are willing to get up and go to work in the morning".</p></div>
