    <div id="article-description"><h3>A Stalled Cease - fire Agreement</h3><p>Since the outbreak of a new round of conflict in 2023, the Gaza Strip has been in a state of "humanitarian purgatory".</p><p>According to UN data, there have been over 110,000 casualties and nearly 2 million people have been displaced.</p><p>Despite mediation efforts led by multiple parties such as Egypt and Qatar, the cease - fire negotiations have been stuck in a deadlock for a long time. Israel insists on "completely disarming Hamas", while the Palestinians demand "immediate opening of humanitarian corridors" and "release of detainees" as pre - conditions for negotiations.</p><h3>What Are 'Humanitarian Corridors'? Why Are They the Biggest Point of Contention? üöë</h3><p>The so - called "humanitarian corridors" refer to temporary routes for medical aid, supplies, and personnel evacuation in the midst of war. However, this seemingly warm - hearted design has actually become the core weapon in the strategic game of all parties:</p><ul><li>Hamas hopes to replenish food and weapons through the corridors.</li><li>The Israeli army is worried that "corridors mean loopholes" and refuses to fully allow passage.</li><li>The United Nations has repeatedly accused the Israeli army of blocking supply convoys, resulting in "refugee camps without water, electricity, or medicine".</li></ul><p>Almost every breakdown in negotiations is related to this "life - saving corridor".</p><h3>Is 'Diplomatic Mediation' Entering a Fatigue Period? üïØÔ∏è</h3><ul><li>Qatar and Egypt: As the main Arab mediators, they have repeatedly proposed a dual - plan of "phased cease - fire + armed control", but it has been rejected by Israel.</li><li>The United States: It seemingly supports Israel but secretly pressures for negotiations, with an inconsistent internal stance.</li><li>The United Nations: It strongly condemns violent acts on the humanitarian level but has difficulty intervening in the actual military conflict.</li></ul><p>Now, there is a popular saying in the diplomatic circle: "No one can persuade Israel except itself."</p><h3>Civilians in the Conflict: Surviving Bombs and Giving Birth in the Desert</h3><p>"My sister gave birth to a baby in a tent, and there wasn't even a pair of scissors to cut the umbilical cord." - A Gaza refugee mother sobbed.</p><p>Humanitarian organizations have revealed that:</p><ul><li>A child is injured in Gaza every 8 minutes.</li><li>90% of hospitals are "running out of supplies", and seriously injured patients undergo surgery without anesthesia.</li><li>Over 1 million people are living in "uncovered open areas". The summer heat, mosquitoes, and water shortage have led to the spread of epidemics.</li><li>In the temporary camps set up by the United Nations, even one set of toilets has to be used by thousands of people in turn...</li></ul><h3>The Struggle Beyond the War: Who Decides on Reconstruction? üß±</h3><p>Even if the war stops, **"who will rebuild Gaza"** has become the focus:</p><ul><li>The United States prefers "the Arab League to take the lead".</li><li>Iran and Hamas emphasize "the necessity of retaining national self - determination rights".</li><li>The United Nations plans to set up a "neutral supervision committee" to manage the reconstruction fund.</li></ul><p>However, behind these political plans lies a huge economic cake and a contest for geopolitical influence.</p><h3>Conclusion: Peace Is Not Just Paper on the Negotiation Table</h3><p>The real question is not "whether to negotiate" but - between the real - life ruins and political calculations, who can truly fight for the future sunshine of the civilians?</p></div>
