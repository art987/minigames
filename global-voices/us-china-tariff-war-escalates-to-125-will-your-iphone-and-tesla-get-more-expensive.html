    <div id="article-description"><h3>A new 'price - hike storm' is brewing...</h3><p>In early 2025, the US announced that it would raise tariffs on Chinese goods such as electric vehicles, batteries, and chips to a maximum of 125%, causing a huge shock in the global market. China is also brewing a new round of counter - measures, and the trade tension has heated up again. For ordinary people, the questions become very real:</p><p> 'Will the iPhone 14 I plan to buy next month still be affordable?'</p><p> 'Is it still worth buying a domestic new - energy vehicle?'</p><p> 'Will laptops and electric vehicles skyrocket in price?'</p><h3>Who will 'foot the bill'? - Each of us consumers!</h3><p>When tariffs escalate, a chain reaction of soaring manufacturing costs, supply - chain relocation, delivery delays, and price increases occurs:</p><ul><li>Smartphones: Apple's supply chain highly depends on China, and the price of iPhones may rise by 5 - 10%.</li><li>Electric vehicles: Tesla's Model 3/Y are produced in Shanghai, and the tax burden will be directly passed on to European and American buyers.</li><li>Home appliances/3C products: Chinese products from Lenovo, Haier, Midea, etc. will face export barriers.</li></ul><p>For Chinese consumers, price hikes of US brands in response, logistics delays, and the trend of domestic substitution are emerging.</p><h3>Why is the 'tech tariff war' suddenly intensifying? üîç</h3><p>1. Political maneuvering during the US election year: Taking a high - profile 'tough stance' against China can attract voter support and is seen as a bargaining chip.</p><p>2. Protecting domestic new - energy enterprises: The US tries to use tariffs to curb the 'crazy expansion' of Chinese electric vehicles in the US market.</p><p>3. China's powerful industrial chain: In 2024, China's technological advantages in fields such as AI chips and battery materials alerted its competitors.</p><h3>How are enterprises responding? - Parallel strategies of 'diversifying globally' and 'domestic substitution'</h3><p>1. Multinational giants are accelerating the transfer of their supply chains:</p><ul><li>Apple is shifting more assembly lines to India and Vietnam.</li><li>Tesla is considering expanding its factory in Mexico to avoid tariffs.</li></ul><p>2. Chinese enterprises are promoting the domestic cycle and exploring the Belt and Road markets:</p><ul><li>Companies like Huawei and BYD are targeting emerging markets in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and South America.</li><li>Domestic consumers' support for 'de - Americanized' products is on the rise.</li></ul><h3>What's the future trend? Will it be a return to the Cold - War era or a warming - up of negotiations?</h3><p>Currently, an intensification of frictions in the short term is inevitable, but the basic economic logic will eventually return to rationality:</p><ul><li>High tariffs will increase the costs of domestic enterprises, hurting both sides.</li><li>Reconstructing the supply chain is not an overnight task, and 'Made in China' is still irreplaceable.</li><li> 'Tech competition and cooperation' in fields such as AI, energy, and chips will dominate the new cycle.</li></ul><h3>For you and me, how can we avoid the 'price - hike pit'?</h3><ul><li>‚úÖ Purchase 3C products highly dependent on imports (such as iPhones, graphics cards, Teslas) in advance.</li><li>‚úÖ Pay attention to the performance of domestic substitute brands (such as Xiaomi cars, Huawei Mate series).</li><li>‚úÖ Closely monitor price changes on cross - border e - commerce platforms and place orders during the window period.</li></ul><h3>Conclusion:</h3><p>When tariffs become a 'new Cold - War weapon', we can't just passively bear price fluctuations. Understanding the economic logic behind this game is a self - awakening for every consumer.</p></div>
